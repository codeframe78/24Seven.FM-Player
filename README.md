# 24Seven.FM Player

An unofficial, community-built native Android client for the 24seven.FM internet-radio network.

The application is written in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose and Jetpack Media3. It does not use a WebView and is not affiliated with or endorsed by 24seven.FM or its stations.

## Supported stations

- StreamingSoundtracks.com
- 1980s.FM
- Adagio.FM
- Death.FM
- Entranced.FM

## Alpha status

Milestones M1–M16 and M18–M22 are complete on the development branch. M17 Private Messages remains deferred for legacy server repair. All five station-certification gates now pass; the expanded M23 Play-testing readiness program is in progress and publication remains at M24.

The current Alpha provides a responsive native player, service-owned Media3 playback, five-station navigation, device-local startup/last-station preferences, live metadata and artwork, queue/history, an independent five-station account dashboard with Android-protected sessions, chat, song requests, signed-in favorite-track browsing, a verified SST request-history/cooldown/membership surface, and a trusted browser directory for selected public station content. The media notification body reopens the existing player task, station-library search supports title/album/artist/genre, and Library/Favorites results can be sorted by station order or play state. Request availability is conservatively revalidated against fresh station and Queue data before submission, with indexed resolution keeping a full 1,500-track VIP/RIP Favorites list responsive. Public community content is now hidden behind an adult age screen, versioned Terms acceptance, and a separate mature-content reveal, with native report-content/report-user/block-user actions and station-scoped local block management. All 126 unit tests, debug lint, release bundle checks, the established API 35/API 36 suites, 33/33 tests on Pixel Fold half-open/closed states and the final 34/34 suite on Pixel Tablet portrait, the earlier 21/21 physical Razr suite, Windows validation, and physical Razr inspection are green. The adaptive device contract and evidence are recorded in [the M23 compatibility matrix](docs/m23-device-compatibility.md).

## Project Roadmap

This is the single milestone sequence for the project. Detailed completion gates, estimates, dependencies, and confidence risks are maintained in [the implementation plan](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).

### Current progression

- **Completed:** M1–M16, all five station certifications (M18–M22), M23.3 Android 16 / API 36 readiness, and M23.7 adaptive launcher/store polish.
- **Active:** M23 Play-testing readiness, with 2 of 7 reviewable sub-milestones complete.
- **Active focus:** M23.2 UGC safety and moderation. Administrator authorization is recorded and the [native implementation](docs/m23-ugc-safety-validation.md) is test-green; completion is waiting only for confirmation that the single harmless report reached the moderator inbox and reconciliation of that server response.
- **Remaining release gates:** M23.1 current-head signed candidate, M23.2 report-receipt reconciliation, M23.4 Play declarations, M23.5 rights evidence, M23.6 physical/Play pre-launch coverage, then the explicitly authorized M24 Alpha publication.
- **Deferred:** M17 Private Messages remains excluded from the shipping build until the reproduced server-side delivery failure is repaired and verified.

### Phase 2 — Shared feature completion

| Milestone | Size | Estimate | Status | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M13 Independent Accounts UX | L | 4–8 hours | ✅ Complete ([`9ef1f1c`](https://github.com/codeframe78/24Seven.FM-Player/commit/9ef1f1c)) | Five separately visible account states with pairwise session/logout/expiration isolation |
| M14 Local personalization | M | 2–4 hours | ✅ Complete ([`81c2c4e`](https://github.com/codeframe78/24Seven.FM-Player/commit/81c2c4e)) | Persist default/last station and clearly distinguish local preferences from station-owned data |
| M15 Request history and membership | L | 4–8 hours | ✅ Complete ([`b19d5fe`](https://github.com/codeframe78/24Seven.FM-Player/commit/b19d5fe)) | Memory-only SST last-ten history, cooldown/readiness, and explicit membership with conservative unknown states |
| M16 Secondary content access | M | 2–4 hours | ✅ Complete ([`90a7f98`](https://github.com/codeframe78/24Seven.FM-Player/commit/90a7f98)) | Allowlisted same-station HTTPS Custom Tabs for selected public modules; the original Death.FM TLS boundary was safely deferred and later reverified in M21 |
| M17 Private Messages | L provisional | 4–8 hours after server repair | 🧊 Deferred | Inbox and Sent Box discovery succeeded, but New Message selection remains suspect and a profile-originated MorgHubby test was not delivered; the site owner has the reproduced result |

### Phase 3 — Station certification

These milestones harden and certify the shared app against each station; they do not create five forks. Station-specific behavior remains behind capability flags and repository contracts.

| Milestone | Size | Estimate | Status | Certification emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M18 StreamingSoundtracks.com | S | 2–4 hours | ✅ Complete ([evidence](docs/m18-sst-certification.md)) | VIP/non-admin behavior, 30-row Queue, request messages, Favorites, chat, and authenticated workflows |
| M19 1980s.FM | M | 4–7 hours | ✅ Complete ([evidence](docs/m19-1980s-certification.md)) | Independent sign-in/restore/logout, authenticated Favorites/Chat/requests, station rules, metadata, Queue, and fallback |
| M20 Adagio.FM | M | 4–7 hours | ✅ Complete ([evidence](docs/m20-adagio-certification.md)) | Classical metadata presentation, independent sign-in/restore/logout, authenticated Favorites/Chat/requests, Queue, and fallback |
| M21 Death.FM | L | 6–10 hours | ✅ Complete ([evidence](docs/m21-death-certification.md)) | Compact Queue feed, sparse metadata/artwork, independent sign-in/restore/logout, authenticated Favorites/Chat/requests, RIP boundaries, and fallback |
| M22 Entranced.FM | M | 4–7 hours | ✅ Complete ([evidence](docs/m22-entranced-certification.md)) | Independent sign-in/restore/logout, authenticated Favorites/Chat/requests, extended Queue, fallback, and legacy ICY punctuation hardening |

Each station gate covers playback and fallback, metadata/artwork, Queue/history, authentication, chat, Favorites, requests, membership differences, Private Messages when available, physical-device smoke testing, documentation, tests, and remote publication. Unblocked certification work may proceed while M17 is deferred, but final station completion requires every in-scope capability to pass or an explicit scope decision.

### Phase 4 — Distribution

| Milestone | Size | Estimate | Status | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M23 Play-testing readiness program | XL, split below | 3–6 focused days plus owner/external input | 🚧 In progress | Preserve the completed distribution preparation while closing release-artifact, UGC, API 36, review, rights, device, and launcher-quality gates as separate reviewable milestones |
| M24 Alpha publication | M | 1–3 hours after Console setup | ⏳ Planned | Verify the signed Play bundle and publish the authorized internal/closed test release |

#### M23 reviewable sub-milestones

| Milestone | Size | Codex estimate | Status | Required outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M23.1 Current-head signed release candidate | M | 2–4 hours | ⏳ Planned | Sign and inspect the exact current source, verify upload identity/versioning/16 KB packaging, complete dependency and third-party-license notices, and validate Play installation |
| M23.2 UGC safety and moderation | L, split into research and implementation | 6–12 hours after station input | 🚧 Implementation green; receipt pending ([evidence](docs/m23-ugc-safety-validation.md)) | Authorized native age/Terms/reveal gates, separate report and block actions, local block management, privacy boundaries, and duplicate-safe indeterminate delivery are implemented; administrator receipt confirmation remains |
| M23.3 Android 16 / API 36 readiness | M | 2–4 hours | ✅ Complete ([evidence](docs/m23-api36-readiness.md)) | Targets API 36; 117 unit tests, lint/release bundle, 27/27 API 36 connected tests, and cold-launch/two-Back visual inspection pass |
| M23.4 Play review declarations | M | 2–4 hours plus owner input | 🚧 Local packet prepared ([evidence](docs/m23-play-declaration-packet.md)) | Accurate listing and copy-ready foreground-service/reviewer instructions are prepared; reusable reviewer credentials, final video link, content-rating answers, station retention, and Console submission remain owner-controlled |
| M23.5 Brand and content-rights evidence | S | 1–2 hours plus external confirmation | ⏳ Planned | Retain private written authorization covering the app/station names, logos, artwork, streams, screenshots, and Google Play testing/distribution; publish only a sanitized confirmation |
| M23.6 Release device matrix and pre-launch report | M | 3–6 hours | 🚧 Local matrix expanded ([evidence](docs/m23-device-compatibility.md)) | Minimum API, API 36, 16 KB runtime, Pixel Fold open/half-open/closed, and Pixel Tablet portrait/landscape are green; physical Razr hinge, Play delivery/update, and Play pre-launch results remain |
| M23.7 Adaptive launcher/store polish | S | 1–2 hours | ✅ Complete ([evidence](docs/m23-launcher-polish.md)) | Preserves the established logo in density-specific legacy and masked adaptive icons, adds an Android 13 monochrome layer, and revalidates the existing store assets |

M23 is active on this branch. The Google Play developer account and app record are established, Play App Signing is selected, the no-ads/non-government/no-financial/no-health declarations are saved, the public [privacy notice](https://codeframe78.github.io/24Seven.FM-Player/) is live and recorded in Console, and the public support email plus Music & Audio category are saved. The owner selected an 18+ target audience consistent with the adult legacy-station community and existing freeform chat; Console entry remains locked behind reviewer-access setup. Play-ready graphics and device screenshots are prepared; compact/medium/expanded layouts, genuine fold/tablet states, notification-to-app navigation, multi-field library search, play-state sorting, full-list Favorites responsiveness, 16 KB runtime, and API 36 targeting are validated. Protected upload signing and recovery are green, but the recorded signed candidate predates the latest product fixes and must be regenerated from current HEAD. M23.2 now has administrator authorization plus native age/Terms/reveal gates, separate report-content/report-user/block-user actions, and station-scoped block management; its only open implementation evidence is reconciling the single harmless report with the administrator inbox. Foreground-service evidence, explicit brand/content rights, physical Razr hinge coverage, reviewer credentials, final audience/content/Data Safety declarations, tester setup, Play delivery/pre-launch results, and explicit publication authorization also remain gates. M17 Private Messages is not shipped and does not block Alpha testing.

The app is fully native and uses immutable Compose UI state, repository boundaries, and station capability flags. It includes play, pause, stop, live metadata and artwork, a persistent mini-player, signed-in favorite-track browsing/filtering, capability-aware screens, native loading/error/empty states, and Android Keystore-backed account sessions. Remote data stays bounded to the documented station interfaces and their approved refresh rules.

## Screenshots

These captures are from the physical Razr. Most use live station data, so track and chat content will naturally change over time; the M15 request-activity capture intentionally shows the safe signed-out state after a fresh debug install. The Player and Queue captures show the M11 Alpha shell; Chat and Requests retain their already-working native M8–M10 content presentation. The M16 capture shows the original trusted browser directory, while M18–M22 include station-certification evidence.

Audio stream addresses come from station-provided playlists and remain subject to device verification. Remote interfaces are added only after source verification and permission review. See the milestone research and validation documents under [docs](docs) for authorization, protocol evidence, limits, and device results.

M17 tracks the native Private Messages experience, which remains deferred until the website's underlying server issues and production behavior are settled. See [docs/future-scope.md](docs/future-scope.md).

Alpha testers and distributors should read [the privacy notice](PRIVACY.md), [Alpha testing guide](docs/alpha-testing.md), [release notes](docs/releases/0.1.0-alpha01.md), [Play Console checklist](docs/play-console-checklist.md), and [M23 signing handoff](docs/m23-alpha-readiness.md). Development debug APKs are not intended for external distribution.

## Building

Open the repository in a current Android Studio release with JDK 17. The project targets and compiles against Android 16 (API 36), and is currently validated on the primary Motorola Razr 2023 running Android 16. It supports Android 8.0 (API 26) and newer.

From PowerShell, validate the project with:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat testDebugUnitTest lintDebug assembleRelease
```

For an Ubuntu Codex CLI and Android Studio workstation, install the pinned
project toolchain, both API 35/API 36 emulators, and persistent `ANDROID_HOME`
configuration with:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap-ubuntu.sh --accept-licenses
```

The script also installs the ChatGPT Codex CLI. Authenticate afterward with
`codex login`, or use `codex login --device-auth` on a headless host. See the
[Ubuntu development setup](docs/ubuntu-cli-setup.md) for installed components,
options, security boundaries, and verification commands.

If the repository is inside a OneDrive-synced directory and Gradle stalls on file operations, direct app build outputs to a local directory before running Gradle:

```powershell
$env:TWENTYFOURSEVEN_ANDROID_BUILD_DIR="$env:TEMP\24seven-android-build"
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing.

For migration to another Windows development machine, follow [docs/CODEX_HANDOFF.md](docs/CODEX_HANDOFF.md) and run `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\validate-windows.ps1` after cloning.
