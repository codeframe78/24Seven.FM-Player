# 24Seven.FM Player

An unofficial, community-built native Android client for the 24seven.FM internet-radio network.

The application is written in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose and Jetpack Media3. It does not use a WebView and is not affiliated with or endorsed by 24seven.FM or its stations.

## Supported stations

- StreamingSoundtracks.com
- 1980s.FM
- Adagio.FM
- Death.FM
- Entranced.FM

## Alpha status

Milestones M1–M16 and M18 are complete on the development branch. M17 Private Messages remains deferred for legacy server repair. M19 1980s.FM, M20 Adagio.FM, and M21 Death.FM have passed their public/wired-device gates and await representative account evidence. Entranced.FM is the next unblocked certification milestone at M22, with Alpha distribution/publication last at M23–M24.

The current Alpha provides a responsive native player, service-owned Media3 playback, five-station navigation, device-local startup/last-station preferences, live metadata and artwork, queue/history, an independent five-station account dashboard with Android-protected sessions, chat, song requests, signed-in favorite-track browsing, a verified SST request-history/cooldown/membership surface, and a trusted browser directory for selected public station content. Request availability is conservatively revalidated against fresh station and Queue data before submission. All 108 unit tests, lint, debug assembly/install, 21/21 wired Razr tests (129 total tests), and physical Razr inspection are green.

## Project Roadmap

This is the single milestone sequence for the project. Detailed completion gates, estimates, dependencies, and confidence risks are maintained in [the implementation plan](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).

### Phase 2 — Shared feature completion

| Milestone | Size | Estimate | Status | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M13 Independent Accounts UX | L | 4–8 hours | ✅ Complete ([`9ef1f1c`](https://github.com/codeframe78/24Seven.FM-Player/commit/9ef1f1c)) | Five separately visible account states with pairwise session/logout/expiration isolation |
| M14 Local personalization | M | 2–4 hours | ✅ Complete ([`81c2c4e`](https://github.com/codeframe78/24Seven.FM-Player/commit/81c2c4e)) | Persist default/last station and clearly distinguish local preferences from station-owned data |
| M15 Request history and membership | L | 4–8 hours | ✅ Complete ([`b19d5fe`](https://github.com/codeframe78/24Seven.FM-Player/commit/b19d5fe)) | Memory-only SST last-ten history, cooldown/readiness, and explicit membership with conservative unknown states |
| M16 Secondary content access | M | 2–4 hours | ✅ Complete ([`90a7f98`](https://github.com/codeframe78/24Seven.FM-Player/commit/90a7f98)) | Allowlisted same-station HTTPS Custom Tabs for selected public modules; the original Death.FM TLS boundary was safely deferred and later reverified in M21 |
| M17 Private Messages | L provisional | 4–8 hours after server repair | 🧊 Deferred | Native station-isolated inbox, read, compose, reply, refresh, and explicit user-initiated send |

### Phase 3 — Station certification

These milestones harden and certify the shared app against each station; they do not create five forks. Station-specific behavior remains behind capability flags and repository contracts.

| Milestone | Size | Estimate | Status | Certification emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M18 StreamingSoundtracks.com | S | 2–4 hours | ✅ Complete ([evidence](docs/m18-sst-certification.md)) | VIP/non-admin behavior, 30-row Queue, request messages, Favorites, chat, and authenticated workflows |
| M19 1980s.FM | M | 4–7 hours | 🚧 Public/device pass; account evidence pending ([evidence](docs/m19-1980s-certification.md)) | Independent account/session behavior, station rules, requests, Favorites, chat, metadata, and fallback |
| M20 Adagio.FM | M | 4–7 hours | 🚧 Public/device pass; account evidence pending ([evidence](docs/m20-adagio-certification.md)) | Classical metadata presentation, independent account/session behavior, requests, Favorites, chat, and fallback |
| M21 Death.FM | L | 6–10 hours | 🚧 Public/device pass; account evidence pending ([evidence](docs/m21-death-certification.md)) | Compact Queue feed, sparse metadata/artwork, RIP membership behavior, requests, chat, and fallback |
| M22 Entranced.FM | M | 4–7 hours | ▶️ Next unblocked | Independent account/session behavior, station rules, requests, Favorites, chat, metadata, and fallback |

Each station gate covers playback and fallback, metadata/artwork, Queue/history, authentication, chat, Favorites, requests, membership differences, Private Messages when available, wired-device smoke testing, documentation, tests, and remote publication. Unblocked certification work may proceed while M17 is deferred, but final station completion requires every in-scope capability to pass or an explicit scope decision.

### Phase 4 — Distribution

| Milestone | Size | Estimate | Status | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M23 Alpha distribution readiness | M | 1–2 focused days | ⏸ Deferred | Refresh and finalize privacy, signing, tester, bundle, and Play-readiness work after M15–M22 |
| M24 Alpha publication | M | 1–3 hours after Console setup | ⏳ Planned | Verify the signed Play bundle and publish the authorized internal/closed test release |

Early M23 preparation is preserved on this branch, but it will be refreshed only after feature and station certification work. The Google Play developer account was approved on July 14, 2026; remaining release dependencies are app/Play App Signing setup, secure upload-key custody, final validation, and explicit publication authorization.

The app is fully native and uses immutable Compose UI state, repository boundaries, and station capability flags. It includes play, pause, stop, live metadata and artwork, a persistent mini-player, signed-in favorite-track browsing/filtering, capability-aware screens, native loading/error/empty states, and Android Keystore-backed account sessions. Remote data stays bounded to the documented station interfaces and their approved refresh rules.

## Screenshots

These captures are from the physical Razr. Most use live station data, so track and chat content will naturally change over time; the M15 request-activity capture intentionally shows the safe signed-out state after a fresh debug install. The Player and Queue captures show the M11 Alpha shell; Chat and Requests retain their already-working native M8–M10 content presentation. The M16 capture shows the original trusted browser directory, while the M18 and M21 captures record certified live SST and Death.FM states.

Audio stream addresses come from station-provided playlists and remain subject to device verification. Remote interfaces are added only after source verification and permission review. See the milestone research and validation documents under [docs](docs) for authorization, protocol evidence, limits, and device results.

M17 tracks the native Private Messages experience, which remains deferred until the website's underlying server issues and production behavior are settled. See [docs/future-scope.md](docs/future-scope.md).

Alpha testers and distributors should read [the privacy notice](PRIVACY.md), [Alpha testing guide](docs/alpha-testing.md), [release notes](docs/releases/0.1.0-alpha01.md), [Play Console checklist](docs/play-console-checklist.md), and [M23 signing handoff](docs/m23-alpha-readiness.md). Development debug APKs are not intended for external distribution.

## Building

Open the repository in a current Android Studio release with JDK 17. The project targets Android 15 (API 35), compiles against API 36 as required by its AndroidX dependencies, and is currently validated on the primary Motorola Razr 2023 running Android 16. It supports Android 8.0 (API 26) and newer.

From PowerShell, validate the project with:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat testDebugUnitTest lintDebug assembleRelease
```

If the repository is inside a OneDrive-synced directory and Gradle stalls on file operations, direct app build outputs to a local directory before running Gradle:

```powershell
$env:TWENTYFOURSEVEN_ANDROID_BUILD_DIR="$env:TEMP\24seven-android-build"
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing.

For migration to another Windows development machine, follow [docs/CODEX_HANDOFF.md](docs/CODEX_HANDOFF.md) and run `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\validate-windows.ps1` after cloning.
