# 24Seven.FM Player

An unofficial, community-built native Android client for the 24seven.FM internet-radio network.

The application is written in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose and Jetpack Media3. It does not use a WebView and is not affiliated with or endorsed by 24seven.FM or its stations.

## Planned stations

- StreamingSoundtracks.com
- 1980s.FM
- Adagio.FM
- Death.FM
- Entranced.FM

## Current milestone

M1 through M6 are complete. The app includes verified playback and Now Playing behavior plus administrator-authorized live Queue and History data across all five stations.

- Station-first domain model
- MVVM and unidirectional data flow
- Compose phone navigation shell
- Media3 `MediaSessionService` for background playback
- Play, pause, stop, atomic station switching, and one-step stream fallback
- Immutable playback state exposed through a domain-facing controller
- Station-scoped immutable now-playing state behind a repository contract
- Raw live ICY titles in Compose and Android MediaSession metadata
- Evidence-backed AAC / 128 kbps stream quality
- Immutable destination state with capability-aware native screens
- Persistent mini-player outside the Player destination
- Bottom navigation on phones and a navigation rail at 600 dp and wider
- Station-scoped live queue/history with native loading, error, empty, and ready states
- Explicit track title and artist text, station-hosted cover artwork, and a shared 60-second refresh limit
- Repository boundaries for future authentication, chat, and requests
- Safe station-scoped M7 authentication groundwork with no unverified login integration

Audio stream addresses come from station-provided playlists and remain subject to device verification. Remote interfaces are added only after source verification and permission review. See [docs/m6-queue-research.md](docs/m6-queue-research.md) and [docs/m6-validation.md](docs/m6-validation.md) for the queue/history authorization, protocol evidence, limits, and device results.

## Building

Open the repository in a current Android Studio release with JDK 17. The project targets Android 15 (API 35), matching the primary Motorola Razr 2023 test device, and compiles against API 36 as required by its AndroidX dependencies. It supports Android 8.0 (API 26) and newer.

From PowerShell, validate the project with:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat test lint assembleDebug
```

If the repository is inside a OneDrive-synced directory and Gradle stalls on file operations, direct app build outputs to a local directory before running Gradle:

```powershell
$env:TWENTYFOURSEVEN_ANDROID_BUILD_DIR="$env:TEMP\24seven-android-build"
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing.

For migration to another Windows development machine, follow [docs/CODEX_HANDOFF.md](docs/CODEX_HANDOFF.md) and run `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\validate-windows.ps1` after cloning.
