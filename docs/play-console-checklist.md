# Google Play Alpha activation checklist

Use this after the Google Play developer account is activated. Do not place Console credentials, reviewer credentials, upload keys, passwords, or tester email lists in Git.

## Local preparation already complete

- Application ID: `com.codeframe78.twentyfourseven.player`
- Candidate: `0.1.0-alpha01`, version code 2
- Target SDK: 35; compile SDK: 36; minimum SDK: 26
- Privacy notice, Alpha testing guide, release notes, permission review, and device validation are complete.
- Gradle accepts Play upload signing only from four `TWENTYFOURSEVEN_UPLOAD_*` environment variables. Supplying a partial set fails configuration.
- `scripts/validate-play-bundle.ps1` builds the release AAB, requires a real signature, and prints its SHA-256 without revealing signing inputs.

## After account activation

1. Create the app in Play Console with the intended public name, app/game classification, free pricing, support email, and required declarations.
2. Accept Play App Signing. Prefer a Google-generated app-signing key; retain only the separate upload key under project-controlled secure backup.
3. Create the upload key outside this repository and load its path/password/alias through process-scoped environment variables or protected CI secrets.
4. Run `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\validate-play-bundle.ps1` and upload the verified AAB.
5. Start with Internal testing. It supports up to 100 testers and uses a private opt-in/share link rather than public search discovery.
6. Add a feedback email or URL and a tester email list in Console. Do not commit tester identities.
7. Complete the store listing and App content declarations needed by the selected track.

## App-content details to review

- **App access:** Public playback, Queue, and History do not require login. Authentication, Chat posting, and requests do. If Play requests reviewer access, provide a least-privileged non-administrator station account only through Play Console's protected reviewer instructions.
- **Ads:** The app contains no advertising SDK or advertising behavior.
- **Data safety:** Internal-only testing is currently exempt, but closed/open/production releases require an accurate declaration. Account credentials are submitted directly to the selected station, station sessions are encrypted locally, chat history is memory-only, and the app has no analytics or developer backend.
- **Privacy policy:** Play policy requires an active public, non-geofenced web URL for the privacy policy. Host `PRIVACY.md` as a stable web page before submitting the app. The same policy is available as native text under More in the app.
- **Account deletion:** The app does not create station accounts; it only signs into pre-existing station accounts and can remove the local session with Sign out. Confirm the appropriate Console declaration when completing App content.
- **Target audience/content rating:** Complete these from the actual intended audience and station content; do not infer a child-directed audience.

## Release progression

Internal testing is the first rollout and is currently exempt from the Data safety section, but not from the underlying user-data/privacy-policy obligations. Closed testing or production adds the Data safety declaration and may add—for some newer personal developer accounts—testing-duration/participation requirements shown by the activated Console. Treat the Console dashboard as authoritative for the account.
