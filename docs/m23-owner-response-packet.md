# M28–M35 site-owner response packet

Prepared July 18, 2026

Status: monitored moderation destination confirmed; physical Player email-handoff receipt check required

This packet consolidates the factual confirmations still needed from an authorized 24seven.FM representative. Send it
privately. Retain the original response and its sender/date privately; commit only a sanitized completion note. Do not
put reviewer passwords, cookies, tokens, private endpoints, unredacted Console captures, or private correspondence in
Git, Discord, or a public issue.

The moderation authorization already supplied for M28 authorizes app-originated abuse reports. It does not, by
itself, establish permission to use third-party names, logos, artwork, streams, screenshots, or to distribute the app.

## 1. Complete the selected Player email handoff

On July 18, 2026, the project owner confirmed that a dedicated destination is monitored for 24Seven.FM Player moderation reports and received a separately sent sanitized harmless report. Original correspondence is retained privately. The repository intentionally omits the address, message headers, sender identity, and report body.

The owner subsequently directed the Player's Contact Us and moderation-report actions to use that monitored email destination. This keeps administrator behavior outside the Player while giving users an explicit, reviewable native handoff.

After an authorized build is installed on the physical test device:

1. Open Contact Us for one assigned station. Verify the fixed recipient and station-specific subject, then cancel without sending.
2. From an approved synthetic Chat/request target, prepare one newly authorized harmless report.
3. Verify the recipient, station-specific subject, bounded body, and no unexpected private data in the email app.
4. Send it exactly once and confirm one factual outcome:

> I received the clearly labeled M28 harmless report sent through the Player email handoff on [date].

or:

> I did not receive the clearly labeled M28 harmless report sent through the Player email handoff on [date].

The Player must never claim delivery based only on opening the composer. Do not add administrator access, SMTP credentials, silent email delivery, or email-account access to the Player.

## 2. Brand, content, stream, screenshot, and distribution permission

The authorized rights holder should reply with the following statement, adding their name, title/role, and date. If any
scope is not authorized, they should identify the exact excluded item rather than giving a general approval.

> I confirm that I am authorized to grant this permission on behalf of the 24seven.FM network. The 24Seven.FM Player project has non-exclusive, revocable permission to use the 24seven.FM network name; the names StreamingSoundtracks.com, 1980s.FM, Adagio.FM, Death.FM, and Entranced.FM; network and station logos; station-provided artwork and metadata; and the network's authorized public live-stream access in the native app and in privacy-reviewed Google Play materials. This permission covers development, Google Play internal, closed, and open testing, and distribution through Google Play, including a production release, of the unofficial, non-commercial 24Seven.FM Player native Android app. The network confirms that it operates or is authorized to provide the station streams used by the app and permits the app to access those streams for live playback. This permission does not transfer ownership, does not authorize audio downloading or redistribution outside live playback, does not make the app official or endorsed, remains subject to applicable network terms and third-party rights, and may be revoked in writing.
>
> Authorized representative: [full name]
>
> Title/role: [role establishing authority]
>
> Date: [date]

This statement deliberately does not claim ownership of music, album artwork, or other third-party material that the
network does not own. Any station-provided asset that is not actually covered must be omitted or replaced before Play
submission. Public store screenshots should avoid private account data and unnecessary user-generated content even
when the station permits the underlying interface.

After receiving written permission, use Google Play's advance-notice route to submit the private evidence before the
app or listing is reviewed. Google explicitly accepts advance documentation for permission to use third-party brand
names, logos, graphic assets, and audio.

## 3. Station retention facts for Privacy and Data Safety

Please answer these as factual operational details, either once for the network if all five stations share the same
practice or separately for StreamingSoundtracks.com, 1980s.FM, Adagio.FM, Death.FM, and Entranced.FM:

| Data/process | Retained? | Duration or deletion rule | Who can access it? | Shared with any processor/third party? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Successful and failed sign-in submissions | | | | |
| Session records/cookies and account access logs | | | | |
| IP/security/server logs | | | | |
| Station-library search terms | | | | |
| Public Chat posts | | | | |
| Song requests, requester identity, and optional request messages | | | | |
| Abuse reports, reporter contact details, and bounded reported content | | | | |

Also state the contact path a user should use to request access, correction, or deletion where applicable. “Unknown” is
preferable to an invented retention period; unknown fields will remain disclosed as unresolved rather than being
described as ephemeral.

## 4. Google Play reviewer accounts

Create or designate one reusable, least-privileged, non-administrator account for each station. The owner should confirm:

> I confirm that reusable reviewer accounts are active for StreamingSoundtracks.com, 1980s.FM, Adagio.FM, Death.FM, and Entranced.FM; they can sign in from a clean install and a non-owner network; they do not require email OTP, IP allowlisting, an expiring password, or moderator privileges; and they will remain active throughout Google Play review and subsequent updates. The current three-character, case-sensitive CAPTCHA is completed by the reviewer for each sign-in attempt.

Send the actual usernames and passwords only through the protected Play Console App access form. Do not send them in
the site-owner response retained for project evidence. If practical, give each account a small harmless Favorites list
so reviewers can see a non-empty authenticated surface.

## 5. Private Messaging repair confirmation

M47 remains excluded from the shipping build. Resume native investigation only after the owner can provide this factual
confirmation, with real test details replacing the brackets:

> The 24seven.FM Private Messaging send path has been repaired. On [date], a harmless test message sent from [sender test account] to [recipient test account] appeared in the sender's Sent Box and the recipient's Inbox. The normal member-facing Inbox, Sent Box, compose/profile PM, read, reply, and send forms may be investigated for the native app using non-administrator test accounts. The applicable recipient, message-length, rate, storage, and account-tier limits are: [limits].

If compose/profile sends behave differently, describe each path separately. No native PM endpoint or parser will be
implemented from a success page alone; both sender and recipient delivery must be verified.

## Evidence handling and completion gates

- Keep the original rights response, sender identity, authority/role, date, and any attachment in private project records.
- Keep reviewer credentials only in Play Console and the owner's password manager.
- Record only a sanitized repository note such as: “Written authorization covering the documented M30 scope was
  received from an authorized network representative on [date]; original evidence retained privately.”
- M28 completes only after the fixed-recipient implementation passes automated/device checks and one fresh authorized Player email handoff is reconciled with actual receipt.
- M29 completes only after reviewer access, retention facts, the foreground-service video, and the active Console
  questionnaires are saved and reviewed.
- M30 completes only after the full rights statement or an equivalent written grant is received and any exclusions are
  reflected in the artifact/listing.
- M47 restarts only after verified PM delivery and limits are supplied.
