# Milestone Real-World Time Ledger

Last updated: `July 22, 2026 at 3:16:20 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`

This is the permanent time-accounting record for the canonical M01–M60 milestones in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). It
preserves historical uncertainty instead of treating commit spans as labor time. Future milestone work must be
measured prospectively from the actual authorized execution start.

## Cumulative project totals

| Measure | Cumulative value | Qualification |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Total canonical milestones planned | 60 | M01–M60 |
| Total canonical milestones completed | 33 | M01–M28 and M31–M35 |
| Confirmed or reconstructed active hours | 0.00 h identified | Historical active intervals were not recorded, so the real total is unknown. |
| Total automated wait hours | Unknown | Workflow durations exist, but there is no evidence that execution waited on every run. |
| Total user-blocked hours | Unknown | Historical owner, device, approval, credential, and external waits lack complete pause/resume timestamps. |
| Total counted project hours | Unknown | Active execution plus automated wait cannot be reconstructed defensibly. |
| Total elapsed hours across completed milestones | At least 300.49 h | Lower-bound total across 25 observable milestone windows; 8 completed milestones have unknown elapsed duration. |
| Average counted hours per completed milestone | Unknown | Counted project time is unknown for every historical completion. |
| Median counted hours per completed milestone | Unknown | Counted project time is unknown for every historical completion. |
| Longest completed milestone | Unknown by counted time | M34 has the longest observable elapsed lower bound at 90.27 h. |
| Shortest completed milestone | Unknown by counted time | M31 has the shortest observable elapsed lower bound at 0.03 h. |
| Overall forecast versus actual variance | Unknown | Only M13, M14, and M17–M21 retained milestone-specific forecasts, and their actual counted time was not recorded. |
| Confidence classifications | Confirmed 0; Reconstructed 0; Estimated 28; Unknown 32 | One classification per canonical milestone. |
| Ledger last updated | `July 20, 2026 at 7:43:14 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)` | Full date, 12-hour time, seconds, timezone abbreviation, and UTC offset. |

Elapsed totals are arithmetic milestone totals, not unique calendar time. Milestones overlapped, so counted work must
be assigned to only one milestone while each milestone retains its own wall-clock elapsed period. The confidence counts
cover all 60 canonical entries: 25 completed observable windows, the M29/M30 start boundaries, and the M51 research-to-
retirement window are Estimated; every entry without a defensible historical duration is Unknown.

## Master-site program website milestones

Website work requested through the JamesJennison.net program is tracked here because it changes this repository, but it
does not alter the status, numbering, or cumulative totals of the canonical Android M01–M60 roadmap.

| Program milestone | Status | Started | Forecast | Expected completion | Model and reasoning | Active | Automated wait | User-blocked |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Master M12 — Player local migration implementation | Complete | `July 22, 2026 at 1:51:13 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)` | 8–14 active h | By `July 23, 2026 at 3:51:13 AM PDT (UTC−07:00)` if uninterrupted | GPT-5; current default reasoning strength, unchanged | 0.61 h | 0.00 h | 0.00 h |
| Master M13 — Player origin staging | Complete | `July 22, 2026 at 2:50:15 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)` | 1.5–3 active h | By `July 22, 2026 at 5:50:15 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)` if uninterrupted | GPT-5; current default reasoning strength, unchanged | 0.21 h | 0.00 h | 0.00 h |
| Master M14 — Cloudflare and Player TLS verification | Waiting for read-only access | `July 22, 2026 at 3:07:22 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)` | 0.5–1.5 active h | By `July 22, 2026 at 4:37:22 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)` if uninterrupted | GPT-5; current default reasoning strength, unchanged | 0.15 h | 0.00 h | In progress |

### Master M12 — Player local migration implementation

- **Objective:** Reuse the existing Jekyll project portal while implementing the owner-approved dedicated-domain
  routes, James-Jennison identity, curated public content, GitHub-only privacy contact, metadata, accessibility,
  artifact validation, and migration documentation.
- **Authorization and start:** Authorized by the owner and started `July 22, 2026 at 1:51:13 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** GPT-5 with the current default reasoning strength, unchanged;
  8–14 active hours; expected completion by `July 23, 2026 at 3:51:13 AM PDT (UTC−07:00)` if uninterrupted.
- **Completion gates:** Reproducible static build; approved URL and identity migration; reviewed public content;
  keyboard, reduced-motion, responsive, link, metadata, and artifact checks; milestone documentation; and a local
  commit. GitHub push, GitHub Pages changes, Webuzo, DNS, Cloudflare, SSL, staging, and production remain excluded.
- **Completion:** Implementation and validation completed `July 22, 2026 at 2:27:41 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. The measured
  window was 0.61 active hours with no user-blocked interval. Short build and audit executions remained actively
  monitored and did not create a separately measured automated-wait interval.
- **Forecast variance:** 7.39 hours (92.4%) below the 8-hour lower bound. The original forecast reserved time for a
  broader redesign and uncertain portal remediation; owner approval to retain the already strong portal narrowed the
  work to a static-route migration, public-content review, accessibility hardening, validation, and deployment
  preparation.
- **Evidence:** Dedicated-domain and transition validators pass; the browser suite passes nine routes at four
  viewports with keyboard and pointer interaction checks; the final mobile Lighthouse audit is 99/100/100/100 and the
  desktop audit is 100/100/100/100; artifact inventory digest
  `db2d0047cc43168c1d5483df4afc88d0a016da34c81136bb76a27e06ab7e7a7b`.
- **Forecasting lesson:** When a polished static project site already exists, estimate migration separately from visual
  redesign and production infrastructure work. Keep DNS, SSL, Webuzo discovery, staging, and production rollout in
  their own approval-gated forecasts.

Milestone Master M12 time:
Forecast: 8–14 active hours
Counted project time: 0.61 h
Total elapsed time: 0.61 h
User-blocked time excluded: 0.00 h
Forecast variance: 7.39 h below the lower bound (92.4%)
Cumulative counted project time through Milestone Master M12: 0.61 h (master-site program website milestones only; canonical Android cumulative remains Unknown)
```

### Master M13 — Player origin staging

- **Objective:** Create a verified pre-change backup, add only `player.jamesjennison.net` through Webuzo with the
  approved isolated document root, deploy the reviewed static artifact, and validate it through an origin-only method.
- **Authorization and start:** Authorized by the owner and started `July 22, 2026 at 2:50:15 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** GPT-5 with the current default reasoning strength, unchanged;
  1.5–3 active hours; expected completion by `July 22, 2026 at 5:50:15 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)` if uninterrupted.
- **Scope boundary:** Cloudflare, public DNS, certificate issuance or replacement, GitHub push, GitHub Pages changes,
  public staging, and production cutover remain excluded.
- **Completion:** Completed `July 22, 2026 at 3:02:42 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. The measured window was 0.21 active hours
  with no user-blocked or separately measured automated-wait interval.
- **Forecast variance:** 1.29 hours (86.2%) below the 1.5-hour lower bound. Existing root access, the installed Webuzo
  end-user API, a small static artifact, and a local Restic repository made the isolated staging operation faster than
  the original allowance for access discovery, large transfers, or service-level troubleshooting.
- **Evidence:** Webuzo owns the exact isolated domain and document root; artifact digest
  `b6f62600b4ab04a5f124a5f2547e4795fcf8be72225fc4af597809025686a9ca` matches locally and on the origin; all content
  routes, assets, protected paths, and the custom 404 pass; Restic snapshots `40412861`, `21c5494b`, and `0f7293db`
  pass a full data check and streamed restore check; public Player DNS remains absent.
- **Forecasting lesson:** Estimate a Webuzo static-origin stage separately from trusted certificate work, Cloudflare,
  public DNS, security headers, and production cutover. A pre-authorized, prebuilt artifact can be staged quickly when
  each of those higher-risk actions remains in its own gate.

Cumulative counted project time through Milestone Master M13: 0.82 h (master-site program website milestones only; canonical Android cumulative remains Unknown)
```

### Master M14 — Cloudflare and Player TLS verification

- **Objective:** Verify available Cloudflare control-plane access and read the zone, DNS, proxy, SSL/TLS, certificate,
  and rule state needed to produce the exact approval-gated Player DNS and trusted-origin-certificate sequence.
- **Authorization and start:** Authorized by the owner and started `July 22, 2026 at 3:07:22 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** GPT-5 with the current default reasoning strength, unchanged;
  0.5–1.5 active hours; expected completion by `July 22, 2026 at 4:37:22 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)` if uninterrupted.
- **Scope boundary:** Read-only Cloudflare and public-network verification plus local documentation. Cloudflare, DNS,
  Webuzo, certificates, GitHub, GitHub Pages, staging content, and production configuration remain unchanged.
- **Pause:** Active execution paused `July 22, 2026 at 3:16:20 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)` after live DNS, edge TLS, public
  redirects, legacy Page Rules, Webuzo certificates, and ACME behavior were verified. The available credentials lack
  Zone Settings, SSL and Certificates, and modern Rulesets read permissions. The exact SSL/TLS mode and rule state
  cannot be verified without a separately scoped read-only token or connected integration.

| `July 22, 2026 at 3:16:20 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)` | In progress | User-blocked | Await a read-only Cloudflare credential or integration with Zone Settings, SSL and Certificates, and modern Rulesets visibility. | Cloudflare API authorization responses; required permission list in `player-cloudflare-tls-audit.md` | Excluded |

## Definitions and confidence rules

- **Active execution time** is time spent examining, implementing, testing, documenting, or committing milestone work.
- **Automated wait time** is time spent waiting for builds, tests, installations, deployments, or GitHub Actions when
  that wait actually blocks execution.
- **User-blocked time** is time spent waiting for approval, credentials, external access, decisions, device action, or
  other user intervention.
- **Counted project time** is active execution time plus automated wait time. User-blocked time is excluded unless a
  milestone entry explicitly says otherwise.
- **Total elapsed time** is wall-clock time from actual milestone execution start through completion, including pauses.
- **Confirmed** means recorded start and completion timestamps support the duration.
- **Reconstructed** means reliable repository evidence supports the recorded time boundary.
- **Estimated** means incomplete evidence supports only a range or lower bound.
- **Unknown** means the available evidence does not support a defensible duration.

Displayed totals are rounded to two decimals. Source timestamps and calculation boundaries are preserved below in
12-hour format with the full date, seconds, AM/PM, timezone abbreviation, and UTC offset. Commit timestamps,
pull-request spans, workflow durations, and chat events are evidence points; none is silently treated as continuous
active execution.

## Historical reconstruction method

1. Canonical identity and status come from [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and
   [MILESTONE_MIGRATION.md](MILESTONE_MIGRATION.md). GitHub Project #1 independently reports 60 canonical items and
   corroborates the 33 `Complete` states and their evidence checkpoints.
2. A `No later than` or `Earliest evidence` timestamp is the first milestone-specific repository checkpoint found, not
   a recorded actual execution start. Its start-to-completion span is therefore a **minimum observable window**.
3. Completion uses the explicit completion/acceptance commit or merged milestone PR named by the current validation
   documents. When only one checkpoint exists, elapsed duration is Unknown rather than `0.00 h`.
4. GitHub Actions runs corroborate validation, but an asynchronous run does not prove that Codex or a contributor
   waited for its full runtime. Historical automated wait therefore remains Unknown unless a future entry records the
   wait explicitly.
5. Gaps between commits are not classified as active, automated, or user-blocked time without pause evidence.
6. No tags or GitHub Releases existed when this reconstruction was performed. GitHub had 19 PRs; #14–#19 were open
   Dependabot proposals and were not milestone completion records.
7. Historical model labels are recorded only where a milestone document names them. Later planning routes are not
   backdated as the model used for earlier execution.

## Canonical milestone summary

`Unknown` never means zero work. `—` means the milestone is not completed or the field does not yet apply.

## Detailed milestone records

Unless a record overrides it, historical active, automated-wait, and user-blocked intervals are Unknown; counted time
and forecast variance are therefore Unknown. The default variance explanation is that a commit span measures neither
active execution nor blocking wait. The default forecasting lesson is to record authorization/start, validator
begin/end, pauses/resumes, and acceptance in this ledger during execution.

Each record follows the reference ledger's field order. Closely related historical fields remain grouped where the
same incomplete evidence supports all of them; this avoids repeating an unsupported value as though it were measured
independently.

### M01 — Buildable baseline

- **Objective:** Establish a buildable native Kotlin/Compose Android baseline with pinned tooling and verified Windows
  and Ubuntu development paths.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Earliest repository evidence `July 12, 2026 at 9:29:06 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`; completed
  `July 13, 2026 at 2:17:48 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Active, automated-wait, and user-blocked intervals are Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted project time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 16.81 h; forecast variance Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `252716e`, `9184afd`, `e8eb7da`, [m1-validation.md](m1-validation.md), PR #1, and the M01
  Action in the evidence index. **Estimated** because the initial commit is only a start proxy.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** An overnight gap and later revalidation cannot be categorized. Future baseline
  work must open an execution interval before inspection or scaffolding begins.

### M02 — Five-station playback

- **Objective:** Deliver verified five-station Media3 playback, atomic switching, and bounded primary/source fallback.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Earliest evidence `July 13, 2026 at 4:39:00 AM PDT (UTC−07:00)`; completed
  `July 13, 2026 at 2:48:48 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Active, automated-wait, and user-blocked intervals are Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 10.16 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `b92da5a`, `7c7351d`, `d517713`, `5cdade0`, [m2-validation.md](m2-validation.md), PR #1,
  and the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** Device/network validation spans cannot be separated from other gaps. Record each
  device test and automated validator as its own interval.

### M03 — Background and system media

- **Objective:** Validate service-owned background playback, MediaSession controls, audio focus, and accessory behavior.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Earliest evidence `July 13, 2026 at 3:09:06 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`; completed
  `July 13, 2026 at 3:53:17 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Historical category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.74 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `ce5f0f9`, `66e401c`, `9263993`, `4206fee`, [m3-validation.md](m3-validation.md), PR #1,
  and the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** The first commit follows unrecorded validation work. Start timing before the
  first lifecycle or hardware check.

### M04 — Now Playing

- **Objective:** Add and validate live ICY metadata with safe same-station artwork enrichment.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Earliest evidence `July 13, 2026 at 4:42:09 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`; completed
  `July 13, 2026 at 5:25:46 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Historical category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.73 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `f4b9c77`, `0d9e6b3`, later addenda `ae34a26`/`7aced76`,
  [m4-metadata-research.md](m4-metadata-research.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** Later artwork hardening is a post-completion addendum and is not folded into the
  original window. Track follow-up scope under a named milestone or explicit addendum interval.

### M05 — Native navigation

- **Objective:** Deliver adaptive native destinations and the persistent mini-player.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Actual start Unknown; completed `July 13, 2026 at 6:16:52 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. All category intervals are
  Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted and total elapsed time Unknown; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `8133695`, [m5-validation.md](m5-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action. **Unknown**;
  a single completion checkpoint does not establish duration.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** Never infer zero duration from a one-commit milestone. Record execution start
  before the first UI change.

### M06 — Queue and History

- **Objective:** Implement bounded station-scoped Queue and History observation.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Earliest evidence `July 13, 2026 at 6:47:29 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`; completed
  `July 13, 2026 at 7:48:32 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 1.02 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `f7ef354`, `3babdf9`, later presentation fixes `9a9ac02`/`dcae5a2`,
  [m6-validation.md](m6-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** Later fixes are not assumed to extend the original milestone. Log follow-up work
  separately when it changes the accepted gate.

### M07 — Authentication

- **Objective:** Deliver native station login and Android-protected, station-isolated sessions.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Earliest evidence `July 13, 2026 at 8:08:37 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`; completed
  `July 13, 2026 at 9:27:20 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 1.31 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `bb416d0` through `a897794`, [m7-validation.md](m7-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed
  Action. **Estimated**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** The dense commit series is evidence of activity but not a stopwatch. Preserve
  validator and any credential/user-input wait boundaries prospectively.

### M08 — Chat

- **Objective:** Implement native, bounded, station-scoped Chat.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Earliest evidence `July 13, 2026 at 9:38:35 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`; completed
  `July 13, 2026 at 10:11:34 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.55 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `82119ca`, `f99635d`, [m8-validation.md](m8-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action.
  **Estimated**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** Pre-commit research and validation are absent from the timing record. Start the
  ledger before protocol inspection.

### M09 — Song requests

- **Objective:** Add native search, explicit confirmation, and one-shot song-request submission.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Earliest evidence `July 13, 2026 at 10:46:18 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`; completed
  `July 13, 2026 at 11:03:44 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.29 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `e748f27`, `5c50582`, [m9-validation.md](m9-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action.
  **Estimated**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** The short window starts at an implementation commit, not actual execution.
  Record discovery, mutation-safety review, and test waits explicitly.

### M10 — Request attribution and messages

- **Objective:** Add Queue attribution and the verified SST optional request-message flow.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Earliest evidence `July 14, 2026 at 5:48:13 AM PDT (UTC−07:00)`; completed
  `July 14, 2026 at 2:53:36 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 9.09 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `635139d` through `73a0d89`, [m10-validation.md](m10-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed
  Action. **Estimated**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** The long checkpoint span includes unclassified gaps. Record live one-shot tests
  and recovery decisions without storing protected evidence.

### M11 — Adaptive Alpha UI

- **Objective:** Deliver the responsive Alpha shell, previews, semantics, and explicit exit flow while preserving the
  working native feature contracts.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Actual start Unknown; completed `July 14, 2026 at 8:41:24 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Category intervals are
  Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted and total elapsed time Unknown; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `4735f13`, [m11-validation.md](m11-validation.md),
  [m11-ui-preservation-plan.md](m11-ui-preservation-plan.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action. **Unknown**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** M11 and M12 landed together, and no independent start was recorded. Open separate
  intervals when one commit completes multiple milestone gates.

### M12 — Queue-aware request availability

- **Objective:** Add conservative fresh Queue/History eligibility and fail-closed pre-submit checks.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Actual start Unknown; completed `July 14, 2026 at 8:41:24 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Category intervals are
  Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted and total elapsed time Unknown; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `4735f13`, [m12-validation.md](m12-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action. **Unknown**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** The shared completion commit does not reveal M12's start or effort share. Track
  concurrent milestone intervals independently.

### M13 — Independent Accounts UX

- **Objective:** Present five visible, independently actionable station-account states.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Actual start Unknown; implementation completed `July 14, 2026 at 10:07:42 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Category
  intervals are Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Execution model/reasoning not recorded. Original forecast 4–8 active h,
  task complexity level 2, size L.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted and total elapsed time Unknown; forecast difference and percentage Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `9ef1f1c`, documentation `fc0a3c0`, [m13-validation.md](m13-validation.md), and PR #1.
  **Unknown** because there is no start checkpoint.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** The forecast cannot be compared with a commit timestamp. Future forecasts must
  be snapshotted beside an actual start interval.

### M14 — Local personalization

- **Objective:** Add device-local startup/default-station preferences without mixing station-owned data.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Earliest evidence `July 14, 2026 at 10:30:36 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`; documentation completed
  `July 14, 2026 at 10:32:47 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Execution model/reasoning not recorded. Original forecast 2–4 active h,
  task complexity level 2, size M.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.04 h; forecast difference/percentage Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `81c2c4e`, `9100f10`, [m14-validation.md](m14-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action.
  **Estimated**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** A two-minute commit window cannot be compared with an active-hours forecast;
  it demonstrates that the execution start predates the proxy.

### M15 — Request activity and membership

- **Objective:** Add SST request history, cooldown/readiness, and explicit membership evidence.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Earliest evidence `July 14, 2026 at 10:57:06 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`; completed
  `July 14, 2026 at 11:05:19 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.14 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `b19d5fe`, `f16f408`, [m15-validation.md](m15-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action.
  **Estimated**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** The implementation commit is a late lower-bound proxy. Record protocol research
  and authenticated validation intervals prospectively.

- **Objective:** Add allowlisted same-station HTTPS Custom Tab access while retaining the no-WebView boundary.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Earliest evidence `July 14, 2026 at 11:29:27 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`; completed
  `July 14, 2026 at 11:38:09 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.14 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `90a7f98`, `d69c76d`, [m16-validation.md](m16-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action.
  **Estimated**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** M31 later narrowed the shipping catalog but did not erase M16. Track later policy
  corrections under their own milestone time.

### M17 — StreamingSoundtracks.com certification

- **Objective:** Certify public, authenticated, VIP, request, Favorites, and Chat behavior for SST.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Actual start Unknown; certified `July 14, 2026 at 11:58:33 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Category intervals are
  Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Execution model/reasoning not recorded. Original forecast 2–4 active h,
  task complexity level 2, size S.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted and total elapsed time Unknown; forecast difference/percentage Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `02dffa2`, [m18-sst-certification.md](m18-sst-certification.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action.

- **Objective:** Certify independent public, authenticated, and station-specific 1980s.FM behavior.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Earliest evidence `July 15, 2026 at 12:14:10 AM PDT (UTC−07:00)`; completed
  `July 15, 2026 at 5:53:22 AM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Execution model/reasoning not recorded. Original forecast 4–7 active h,

- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 5.65 h; forecast difference/percentage Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `f877adc`, `11f1ee3`, [m19-1980s-certification.md](m19-1980s-certification.md), PR #1, and
  the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** The observable wall-clock window falls inside the active forecast but cannot be
  treated as active time. Record user-entered CAPTCHA/account pauses separately.

### M19 — Adagio.FM certification

- **Objective:** Certify classical metadata and independent authenticated Adagio.FM workflows.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Earliest evidence `July 15, 2026 at 12:37:03 AM PDT (UTC−07:00)`; completed
  `July 15, 2026 at 6:07:04 AM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Category intervals are Unknown.

- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `50541ea`, `5e985ae`, [m20-adagio-certification.md](m20-adagio-certification.md), PR #1, and
  the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** As with M18, a matching wall-clock range is not an actual-time measurement.
  Explicitly time live account and device work in future certifications.

### M20 — Death.FM certification

- **Objective:** Certify compact Queue, sparse metadata, RIP boundaries, and independent authenticated Death.FM flows.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Earliest evidence `July 15, 2026 at 5:09:42 AM PDT (UTC−07:00)`; completed
  `July 15, 2026 at 9:57:52 AM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Execution model/reasoning not recorded. Original forecast 6–10 active h,
  task complexity level 2, size L.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 4.80 h; forecast difference/percentage Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `5a4bdb7`, `6757680`, [m21-death-certification.md](m21-death-certification.md), PR #1, and
  the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** The minimum window is shorter than the active forecast because work before the
  first evidence commit is missing; it is not proof of an underestimate or overestimate.

### M21 — Entranced.FM certification

- **Objective:** Certify extended Queue, legacy ICY punctuation, and authenticated Entranced.FM workflows.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Earliest evidence `July 15, 2026 at 10:22:34 AM PDT (UTC−07:00)`; completed
  `July 15, 2026 at 10:25:07 AM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Category intervals are Unknown.

  task complexity level 2, size M.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.04 h; forecast difference/percentage Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `ec5fb20`, `1e20eea`, [m22-entranced-certification.md](m22-entranced-certification.md), PR #1,
  and the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** The very short final-commit window proves the start proxy is incomplete. Start
  the ledger before live relay and authenticated checks.

- **Objective:** Validate API 36 targeting, edge-to-edge and predictive Back behavior, and platform regressions.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Earliest relevant device/layout evidence `July 15, 2026 at 12:09:53 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`; completed
  `July 15, 2026 at 8:59:21 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Not recorded individually.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 8.82 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `252e3a4`, `44632f1`, [m23-api36-readiness.md](m23-api36-readiness.md), PR #1, and related
  Actions. **Estimated**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** Device work overlaps M34's later acceptance program. Concurrent milestones need
  separate interval attribution instead of duplicating the same active minutes.

### M23 — Adaptive launcher and store polish

- **Objective:** Deliver and validate legacy, adaptive, and monochrome launcher resources.
- **Start, completion, and intervals:** Actual start Unknown; completed `July 15, 2026 at 10:32:39 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Category intervals are
  Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Not recorded individually.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted and total elapsed time Unknown; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `924a38c`, [m23-launcher-polish.md](m23-launcher-polish.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action.
  **Unknown**.

  `July 18, 2026 at 3:04:15 PM PDT (UTC−07:00)`. Active, automated-wait, and user-blocked intervals are Unknown; owner input is documented
  but its exact pause/resume boundary is not.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Execution model/reasoning not recorded. The later M28–M35 umbrella estimate
  was 3–6 focused days plus owner/station input; no original individual M28 forecast was retained.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 64.54 h; individual forecast variance Unknown.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `c6a9450`, `465cb4d`, `9abd69f`, [m23-ugc-safety-research.md](m23-ugc-safety-research.md),
  [m23-ugc-safety-validation.md](m23-ugc-safety-validation.md), and the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** The multi-day wall-clock window includes unmeasured owner/manual gates. Future
  externally assisted milestones must log the user-blocked pause when the request is sent and resume when evidence arrives.

  milestone is waiting externally; exact historical active intervals and the start of the user-blocked pause are Unknown.
- **Model, reasoning strength, and original forecast:** Original execution model/reasoning and forecast were not recorded at start.
  Current routing, added `July 19, 2026 at 6:17:38 AM PDT (UTC−07:00)`, is Sol High with 2–5 active days after all named facts/candidate exist.
- **Counted project time, total elapsed time, and forecast variance:** Active, wait, blocked, counted, and total elapsed durations remain Unknown/ongoing; variance is
  not calculated before completion.
- **Evidence used and confidence classification:** `4aa36d9`, `0fa5040`, `59d6096`, `849b5a0`, `93e8110`, `d3467cf`,
  [m23-play-declaration-packet.md](m23-play-declaration-packet.md), and [m23-data-safety.md](m23-data-safety.md).
  **Estimated** start proxy.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** Do not backdate the July 19 forecast as original. On resume, record a real resume
  timestamp and retain the current external wait as Unknown rather than inventing a duration.

  and [m23-accessibility-validation.md](m23-accessibility-validation.md). **Estimated**.
- **Explanation of variance and forecasting lessons:** This is the longest observable window because it aggregates many devices and
  human checkpoints, not because 90.27 active hours were measured. Log each matrix campaign and manual gate separately.

### M35 — Release Signing and Console Eligibility

- **Objective:** Prove current-head protected signing, exact upload identity, local clean/update lineage, package
  registration, eligible version code, and a repeatable signed build.

## Historical milestone and legacy-ID crosswalk

The roadmap was renumbered on July 18, 2026. Historical records and commit messages retain their original identifiers,
but their work is represented by the canonical rows above and is not added a second time to cumulative totals. The
complete translation layer remains in [MILESTONE_MIGRATION.md](MILESTONE_MIGRATION.md).

| Historical record or scope | Canonical treatment | Duration treatment and assumptions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Legacy M1–M16 | M01–M16 | Same completed work; IDs below M10 gained zero padding. |
| Legacy M18–M22 | M17–M21 | Same station-certification work shifted down one canonical ID. |
| Legacy M23.1–M23.7 slices | M22, M23, M28–M30, M34, and M35 | Each canonical row uses its own evidence boundary; no umbrella M23 duration is added. |
| Legacy M24–M26 and M27.1 | M24–M27 | Same work; M27.1 became canonical M27. |
| Legacy M27.2 authorization, implementation, and validation slices | M36–M38 | Planned work; no actual interval has started. |
| Legacy M28 release slices | M39–M41 | Planned work; no actual interval has started. |
| Legacy M17 private-message repair and delivery slices | M47–M50 | Deferred work; no actual interval has started. |
| Forum F1–F4 | M51–M54 | M51 preserves the research-to-retirement window; M52–M54 never started. |

## Prospective operating procedure

### Start

When the owner authorizes a milestone, immediately add or update its summary row and detailed section with:

1. the actual execution-start timestamp in 12-hour format with the full date, seconds, AM/PM, timezone abbreviation,
   and UTC offset;
2. the approved model and reasoning strength;
3. the original counted-project-time forecast in hours or an hours range and the original expected completion date/time;
4. the authorized objective and completion gates; and
5. the first active interval.

Planning, clarification, and the reasoning gate before authorization do not start the milestone clock.

### Pause and resume

Append each interval rather than overwriting history:

| Started | Ended | Category | Reason or work | Evidence | Hours |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| Full date and 12-hour timestamp with timezone | Full date and 12-hour timestamp with timezone | Active / Automated wait / User-blocked / Other | Concise description | Commit, run, report, or decision | `(ended - started) / 3600` |

Record the pause timestamp, category, and reason at the pause. Record the resume timestamp when work continues. Long
user-response delays are user-blocked, not active execution. An automated job counts as automated wait only when
execution is actually waiting for it. Close an active interval before opening a wait interval so time is not counted
twice.

### Completion

At completion:

1. record the exact completion timestamp;
2. total active, automated-wait, and user-blocked intervals separately;
3. calculate counted project time as active plus automated wait;
4. calculate total elapsed time from execution start through completion;
5. compare counted project time with the original hours forecast in hours and percentage;
6. explain material variance and record forecasting lessons;
7. update cumulative totals, the roadmap, README, Project cards, and public-safe overview where appropriate; and
8. commit this ledger with the rest of the milestone completion documentation.

For a point forecast, variance is `actual - forecast` and percentage variance is
`(actual - forecast) / forecast × 100`. For a range, compare actual with the nearest bound when outside the range and
report `within range` when inside it.

Every milestone completion report must include exactly this information:

```text
Milestone [NUMBER] time:
Forecast: [HOURS OR RANGE]
Counted project time: [HOURS]
Total elapsed time: [HOURS]
User-blocked time excluded: [HOURS]
Forecast variance: [AMOUNT AND PERCENTAGE]
Cumulative counted project time through Milestone [NUMBER]: [HOURS]
```

If an actual value remains unsupported, use `Unknown` and explain why; never replace missing evidence with `0.00`.
Do not call a duration precise unless interval timestamps or an equivalent time-tracking record support that claim.
