# Milestone real-world time ledger

Last updated: `2026-07-20T19:24:30-07:00`

This is the permanent cumulative time record for the canonical M01–M60 roadmap. It separates measured work from
calendar passage and preserves uncertainty where older records did not contain execution timers. Historical commit,
pull-request, and workflow timestamps are evidence checkpoints; they are not silently converted into active work.

## Cumulative project totals

| Measure | Cumulative value |
| --- | --- |
| Total milestones planned | 60 canonical milestones |
| Total milestones completed | 33 (M01–M28 and M31–M35) |
| Total confirmed or reconstructed active hours | Unknown; no historical active-interval log exists |
| Total automated wait hours | Unknown; workflow runtimes exist, but historical blocking/wait intervals and local validator durations were not recorded |
| Total user-blocked hours | Unknown; several owner/external gates are documented without complete pause/resume timestamps |
| Total counted project hours | Unknown |
| Total elapsed hours across completed milestones | At least 300.49 h across 25 observable evidence windows; 8 completed milestones have unknown elapsed duration |
| Average counted hours per completed milestone | Unknown |
| Median counted hours per completed milestone | Unknown |
| Longest and shortest completed milestones | Unknown by counted time. Supplemental observable windows: M34 is longest at least 90.27 h; M31 is shortest at least 0.03 h |
| Overall forecast versus actual variance | Unknown; only M13, M14, and M17–M21 retained milestone-specific forecasts, and their actual counted time was not recorded |
| Confidence classifications | Confirmed: 0; Reconstructed: 0; Estimated: 28; Unknown: 32 |
| Ledger last updated | `2026-07-20T19:24:30-07:00` |

The 300.49-hour figure is a sum of per-milestone minimum observable wall-clock windows. Milestones overlapped, so it
must not be interpreted as 300.49 unique calendar hours or counted project hours. The confidence counts cover all 60
canonical entries: 25 completed observable windows, the in-progress M29/M30 start proxies, and the M51 research-to-
retirement window are Estimated; every entry without a defensible historical duration is Unknown.

## Definitions and operating rules

- **Active execution time** is time spent examining, implementing, testing, documenting, or committing milestone work.
- **Automated wait time** is time spent waiting for builds, tests, installations, deployments, or GitHub Actions.
- **User-blocked time** is time spent waiting for approval, credentials, external access, decisions, or other user action.
- **Total elapsed time** is wall-clock time from actual milestone execution start through completion.
- **Counted project time** is active execution time plus automated wait time. User-blocked time is excluded unless a
  milestone entry explicitly says otherwise.
- Displayed totals round to two decimals. ISO 8601 timestamps are retained as the calculation source.
- For every newly authorized milestone, open an in-progress entry immediately with actual start time, approved model,
  reasoning strength, and the forecast that exists at authorization. Planning and reasoning-gate discussion before
  authorization is not execution time.
- Close active intervals whenever execution stops. Record automated and user-blocked pauses with exact start, reason,
  and resume timestamps. Do not classify a long response gap as active work.
- At completion, calculate category totals, counted time, total elapsed time, forecast difference in hours and percent,
  cumulative totals, variance explanation, and forecasting lessons before committing the milestone documentation.

## Historical reconstruction method

1. Canonical identity and status come from [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and
   [MILESTONE_MIGRATION.md](MILESTONE_MIGRATION.md). GitHub Project #1 independently reports 60 canonical items and
   corroborates the 33 `Complete` states and their evidence checkpoints.
2. A timestamp marked with `*` is the earliest milestone-specific repository checkpoint found, not a recorded actual
   execution start. Its start-to-completion span is therefore a **minimum observable window**.
3. Completion uses the explicit completion/acceptance commit or merged milestone PR named by the current validation
   documents. When only one checkpoint exists, elapsed duration is Unknown rather than `0.00 h`.
4. GitHub Actions runs corroborate validation, but an asynchronous run does not prove that Codex or a contributor
   waited for its full runtime. Historical automated wait therefore remains Unknown unless a future entry records the
   wait explicitly.
5. Gaps between commits are not classified as active, automated, or user-blocked time without pause evidence.
6. No tags or GitHub Releases existed when this reconstruction was performed. GitHub had 19 PRs; #14–#19 were open
   Dependabot proposals and were not milestone completion records.
7. Historical model labels are recorded only where a milestone document names them. Later planning routes are not
   backdated as the model used for earlier execution.

Confidence classifications mean:

- **Confirmed** — actual execution start and completion timestamps are recorded.
- **Reconstructed** — reliable records support both endpoints and a defensible duration.
- **Estimated** — the available window is incomplete, normally because its start is an earliest-evidence proxy.
- **Unknown** — evidence cannot support a defensible duration.

## Milestone summary

`Unknown` never means zero work. `—` means the milestone is not completed or the field does not yet apply.

## Historical GitHub corroboration

The final linked Action is evidence that validation automation ran; its duration is not counted as historical wait
without a contemporaneous record that milestone execution was blocked on it. PR #1 contains the original M01–M23
development series. M24–M27 have focused milestone PRs. M28 and M31–M35 completed through direct commits.

## Detailed milestone records

Unless a record overrides it, historical active, automated-wait, and user-blocked intervals are Unknown; counted time
and forecast variance are therefore Unknown. The default variance explanation is that a commit span measures neither
active execution nor blocking wait. The default forecasting lesson is to record authorization/start, validator
begin/end, pauses/resumes, and acceptance in this ledger during execution.

### M01 — Buildable baseline

- **Objective:** Establish a buildable native Kotlin/Compose Android baseline with pinned tooling and verified Windows
  and Ubuntu development paths.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest repository evidence `2026-07-12T21:29:06-07:00`*; completed
  `2026-07-13T14:17:48-07:00`. Active, automated-wait, and user-blocked intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted project time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 16.81 h; forecast variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `252716e`, `9184afd`, `e8eb7da`, [m1-validation.md](m1-validation.md), PR #1, and the M01
  Action in the evidence index. **Estimated** because the initial commit is only a start proxy.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** An overnight gap and later revalidation cannot be categorized. Future baseline
  work must open an execution interval before inspection or scaffolding begins.

### M02 — Five-station playback

- **Objective:** Deliver verified five-station Media3 playback, atomic switching, and bounded primary/source fallback.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest evidence `2026-07-13T04:39:00-07:00`*; completed
  `2026-07-13T14:48:48-07:00`. Active, automated-wait, and user-blocked intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 10.16 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `b92da5a`, `7c7351d`, `d517713`, `5cdade0`, [m2-validation.md](m2-validation.md), PR #1,
  and the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** Device/network validation spans cannot be separated from other gaps. Record each
  device test and automated validator as its own interval.

### M03 — Background and system media

- **Objective:** Validate service-owned background playback, MediaSession controls, audio focus, and accessory behavior.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest evidence `2026-07-13T15:09:06-07:00`*; completed
  `2026-07-13T15:53:17-07:00`. Historical category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.74 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `ce5f0f9`, `66e401c`, `9263993`, `4206fee`, [m3-validation.md](m3-validation.md), PR #1,
  and the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** The first commit follows unrecorded validation work. Start timing before the
  first lifecycle or hardware check.

### M04 — Now Playing

- **Objective:** Add and validate live ICY metadata with safe same-station artwork enrichment.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest evidence `2026-07-13T16:42:09-07:00`*; completed
  `2026-07-13T17:25:46-07:00`. Historical category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.73 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `f4b9c77`, `0d9e6b3`, later addenda `ae34a26`/`7aced76`,
  [m4-metadata-research.md](m4-metadata-research.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** Later artwork hardening is a post-completion addendum and is not folded into the
  original window. Track follow-up scope under a named milestone or explicit addendum interval.

### M05 — Native navigation

- **Objective:** Deliver adaptive native destinations and the persistent mini-player.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Actual start Unknown; completed `2026-07-13T18:16:52-07:00`. All category intervals are
  Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted and total elapsed time Unknown; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `8133695`, [m5-validation.md](m5-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action. **Unknown**;
  a single completion checkpoint does not establish duration.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** Never infer zero duration from a one-commit milestone. Record execution start
  before the first UI change.

### M06 — Queue and History

- **Objective:** Implement bounded station-scoped Queue and History observation.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest evidence `2026-07-13T18:47:29-07:00`*; completed
  `2026-07-13T19:48:32-07:00`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 1.02 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `f7ef354`, `3babdf9`, later presentation fixes `9a9ac02`/`dcae5a2`,
  [m6-validation.md](m6-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** Later fixes are not assumed to extend the original milestone. Log follow-up work
  separately when it changes the accepted gate.

### M07 — Authentication

- **Objective:** Deliver native station login and Android-protected, station-isolated sessions.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest evidence `2026-07-13T20:08:37-07:00`*; completed
  `2026-07-13T21:27:20-07:00`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 1.31 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `bb416d0` through `a897794`, [m7-validation.md](m7-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed
  Action. **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** The dense commit series is evidence of activity but not a stopwatch. Preserve
  validator and any credential/user-input wait boundaries prospectively.

### M08 — Chat

- **Objective:** Implement native, bounded, station-scoped Chat.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest evidence `2026-07-13T21:38:35-07:00`*; completed
  `2026-07-13T22:11:34-07:00`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.55 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `82119ca`, `f99635d`, [m8-validation.md](m8-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action.
  **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** Pre-commit research and validation are absent from the timing record. Start the
  ledger before protocol inspection.

### M09 — Song requests

- **Objective:** Add native search, explicit confirmation, and one-shot song-request submission.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest evidence `2026-07-13T22:46:18-07:00`*; completed
  `2026-07-13T23:03:44-07:00`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.29 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `e748f27`, `5c50582`, [m9-validation.md](m9-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action.
  **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** The short window starts at an implementation commit, not actual execution.
  Record discovery, mutation-safety review, and test waits explicitly.

### M10 — Request attribution and messages

- **Objective:** Add Queue attribution and the verified SST optional request-message flow.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest evidence `2026-07-14T05:48:13-07:00`*; completed
  `2026-07-14T14:53:36-07:00`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 9.09 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `635139d` through `73a0d89`, [m10-validation.md](m10-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed
  Action. **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** The long checkpoint span includes unclassified gaps. Record live one-shot tests
  and recovery decisions without storing protected evidence.

### M11 — Adaptive Alpha UI

- **Objective:** Deliver the responsive Alpha shell, previews, semantics, and explicit exit flow while preserving the
  working native feature contracts.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Actual start Unknown; completed `2026-07-14T20:41:24-07:00`. Category intervals are
  Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted and total elapsed time Unknown; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `4735f13`, [m11-validation.md](m11-validation.md),
  [m11-ui-preservation-plan.md](m11-ui-preservation-plan.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action. **Unknown**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** M11 and M12 landed together, and no independent start was recorded. Open separate
  intervals when one commit completes multiple milestone gates.

### M12 — Queue-aware request availability

- **Objective:** Add conservative fresh Queue/History eligibility and fail-closed pre-submit checks.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Actual start Unknown; completed `2026-07-14T20:41:24-07:00`. Category intervals are
  Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted and total elapsed time Unknown; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `4735f13`, [m12-validation.md](m12-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action. **Unknown**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** The shared completion commit does not reveal M12's start or effort share. Track
  concurrent milestone intervals independently.

### M13 — Independent Accounts UX

- **Objective:** Present five visible, independently actionable station-account states.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Actual start Unknown; implementation completed `2026-07-14T22:07:42-07:00`. Category
  intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Execution model/reasoning not recorded. Original forecast 4–8 active h,
  task complexity level 2, size L.
- **Time and variance:** Counted and total elapsed time Unknown; forecast difference and percentage Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `9ef1f1c`, documentation `fc0a3c0`, [m13-validation.md](m13-validation.md), and PR #1.
  **Unknown** because there is no start checkpoint.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** The forecast cannot be compared with a commit timestamp. Future forecasts must
  be snapshotted beside an actual start interval.

### M14 — Local personalization

- **Objective:** Add device-local startup/default-station preferences without mixing station-owned data.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest evidence `2026-07-14T22:30:36-07:00`*; documentation completed
  `2026-07-14T22:32:47-07:00`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Execution model/reasoning not recorded. Original forecast 2–4 active h,
  task complexity level 2, size M.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.04 h; forecast difference/percentage Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `81c2c4e`, `9100f10`, [m14-validation.md](m14-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action.
  **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** A two-minute commit window cannot be compared with an active-hours forecast;
  it demonstrates that the execution start predates the proxy.

### M15 — Request activity and membership

- **Objective:** Add SST request history, cooldown/readiness, and explicit membership evidence.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest evidence `2026-07-14T22:57:06-07:00`*; completed
  `2026-07-14T23:05:19-07:00`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.14 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `b19d5fe`, `f16f408`, [m15-validation.md](m15-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action.
  **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** The implementation commit is a late lower-bound proxy. Record protocol research
  and authenticated validation intervals prospectively.

### M16 — Secondary content access

- **Objective:** Add allowlisted same-station HTTPS Custom Tab access while retaining the no-WebView boundary.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest evidence `2026-07-14T23:29:27-07:00`*; completed
  `2026-07-14T23:38:09-07:00`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.14 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `90a7f98`, `d69c76d`, [m16-validation.md](m16-validation.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action.
  **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** M31 later narrowed the shipping catalog but did not erase M16. Track later policy
  corrections under their own milestone time.

### M17 — StreamingSoundtracks.com certification

- **Objective:** Certify public, authenticated, VIP, request, Favorites, and Chat behavior for SST.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Actual start Unknown; certified `2026-07-14T23:58:33-07:00`. Category intervals are
  Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Execution model/reasoning not recorded. Original forecast 2–4 active h,
  task complexity level 2, size S.
- **Time and variance:** Counted and total elapsed time Unknown; forecast difference/percentage Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `02dffa2`, [m18-sst-certification.md](m18-sst-certification.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action.
  **Unknown** because only certification completion is timestamped.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** Evidence-only certification can still consume live-test time; record the
  certification start even when no code change is expected.

### M18 — 1980s.FM certification

- **Objective:** Certify independent public, authenticated, and station-specific 1980s.FM behavior.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest evidence `2026-07-15T00:14:10-07:00`*; completed
  `2026-07-15T05:53:22-07:00`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Execution model/reasoning not recorded. Original forecast 4–7 active h,
  task complexity level 2, size M.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 5.65 h; forecast difference/percentage Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `f877adc`, `11f1ee3`, [m19-1980s-certification.md](m19-1980s-certification.md), PR #1, and
  the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** The observable wall-clock window falls inside the active forecast but cannot be
  treated as active time. Record user-entered CAPTCHA/account pauses separately.

### M19 — Adagio.FM certification

- **Objective:** Certify classical metadata and independent authenticated Adagio.FM workflows.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest evidence `2026-07-15T00:37:03-07:00`*; completed
  `2026-07-15T06:07:04-07:00`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Execution model/reasoning not recorded. Original forecast 4–7 active h,
  task complexity level 2, size M.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 5.50 h; forecast difference/percentage Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `50541ea`, `5e985ae`, [m20-adagio-certification.md](m20-adagio-certification.md), PR #1, and
  the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** As with M18, a matching wall-clock range is not an actual-time measurement.
  Explicitly time live account and device work in future certifications.

### M20 — Death.FM certification

- **Objective:** Certify compact Queue, sparse metadata, RIP boundaries, and independent authenticated Death.FM flows.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest evidence `2026-07-15T05:09:42-07:00`*; completed
  `2026-07-15T09:57:52-07:00`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Execution model/reasoning not recorded. Original forecast 6–10 active h,
  task complexity level 2, size L.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 4.80 h; forecast difference/percentage Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `5a4bdb7`, `6757680`, [m21-death-certification.md](m21-death-certification.md), PR #1, and
  the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** The minimum window is shorter than the active forecast because work before the
  first evidence commit is missing; it is not proof of an underestimate or overestimate.

### M21 — Entranced.FM certification

- **Objective:** Certify extended Queue, legacy ICY punctuation, and authenticated Entranced.FM workflows.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest evidence `2026-07-15T10:22:34-07:00`*; completed
  `2026-07-15T10:25:07-07:00`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Execution model/reasoning not recorded. Original forecast 4–7 active h,
  task complexity level 2, size M.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.04 h; forecast difference/percentage Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `ec5fb20`, `1e20eea`, [m22-entranced-certification.md](m22-entranced-certification.md), PR #1,
  and the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** The very short final-commit window proves the start proxy is incomplete. Start
  the ledger before live relay and authenticated checks.

### M22 — Android 16 and API 36 readiness

- **Objective:** Validate API 36 targeting, edge-to-edge and predictive Back behavior, and platform regressions.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest relevant device/layout evidence `2026-07-15T12:09:53-07:00`*; completed
  `2026-07-15T20:59:21-07:00`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded individually.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 8.82 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `252e3a4`, `44632f1`, [m23-api36-readiness.md](m23-api36-readiness.md), PR #1, and related
  Actions. **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** Device work overlaps M34's later acceptance program. Concurrent milestones need
  separate interval attribution instead of duplicating the same active minutes.

### M23 — Adaptive launcher and store polish

- **Objective:** Deliver and validate legacy, adaptive, and monochrome launcher resources.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Actual start Unknown; completed `2026-07-15T22:32:39-07:00`. Category intervals are
  Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded individually.
- **Time and variance:** Counted and total elapsed time Unknown; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `924a38c`, [m23-launcher-polish.md](m23-launcher-polish.md), PR #1, and the indexed Action.
  **Unknown**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** Image/resource production time is absent from Git. Open the timer before asset
  inspection or generation.

### M24 — Sleep Timer

- **Objective:** Add a bounded, service-owned timer with restoration, adjustment, cancellation, and deterministic expiry.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest evidence `2026-07-16T16:46:35-07:00`*; merged/completed
  `2026-07-16T17:01:06-07:00`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.24 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `b713783`, `1a0516e`, merge `feb24f7`, [m24-sleep-timer-validation.md](m24-sleep-timer-validation.md),
  PR #7, and the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** The first commit already contains implementation; PR duration is not total
  execution. Begin measurement before code examination and record local Gradle/device waits.

### M25 — System Audio-Output Selection

- **Objective:** Add Android-managed output selection and accurate audio-policy route state without adding Cast.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest evidence `2026-07-16T17:18:02-07:00`*; merged/completed
  `2026-07-16T17:50:41-07:00`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.54 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `85fbca3`, `183ccc0`, `68e5ab8`, merge `3588c7d`,
  [m25-audio-output-validation.md](m25-audio-output-validation.md), and PR #8. **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** The physical correction is visible in commits, but device handoff/test wait is
  unmeasured. Time physical validation separately from implementation.

### M26 — In-App Diagnostics

- **Objective:** Add a privacy-safe, user-reviewed, fixed-allowlist diagnostics snapshot with explicit copy/share.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest evidence `2026-07-16T18:07:48-07:00`*; merged/completed
  `2026-07-16T18:21:05-07:00`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.22 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `7aedbfc`, `3aa0b74`, merge `32b7355`, [m26-diagnostics-validation.md](m26-diagnostics-validation.md),
  PR #9, and the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** Implementation predates the start proxy. Record privacy review as active work and
  Jekyll/Gradle/device runs as automated waits when actually awaited.

### M27 — Local Chat-Mention Notifications

- **Objective:** Add opt-in exact-name notifications from the actively observed Chat feed without claiming closed-app push.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest evidence `2026-07-16T19:05:07-07:00`*; merged/completed
  `2026-07-16T19:09:16-07:00`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.07 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `d902cbd`, merge `afd563a`, [m27-community-notification-validation.md](m27-community-notification-validation.md),
  and PR #11. **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** The four-minute commit-to-merge window excludes implementation. A focused PR is
  useful evidence but not a start timer.

### M28 — UGC Safety and Ongoing Moderation

- **Objective:** Add Terms/age/reveal safeguards, report and local block controls, a fixed-recipient user-reviewed email
  handoff, physical composer validation, and an owner-confirmed one-shot receipt check.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest implementation evidence `2026-07-15T22:32:07-07:00`*; completed
  `2026-07-18T15:04:15-07:00`. Active, automated-wait, and user-blocked intervals are Unknown; owner input is documented
  but its exact pause/resume boundary is not.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Execution model/reasoning not recorded. The later M28–M35 umbrella estimate
  was 3–6 focused days plus owner/station input; no original individual M28 forecast was retained.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 64.54 h; individual forecast variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `c6a9450`, `465cb4d`, `9abd69f`, [m23-ugc-safety-research.md](m23-ugc-safety-research.md),
  [m23-ugc-safety-validation.md](m23-ugc-safety-validation.md), and the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** The multi-day wall-clock window includes unmeasured owner/manual gates. Future
  externally assisted milestones must log the user-blocked pause when the request is sent and resume when evidence arrives.

### M29 — Play Declarations, Privacy, and Data Safety

- **Objective:** Reconcile the exact artifact, reviewer access, audience/content/UGC classification, privacy/Data Safety,
  station retention/deletion/processor/IP facts, account boundaries, and media-playback evidence.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest Play-declaration evidence `2026-07-15T22:42:33-07:00`*. Not completed. The
  milestone is waiting externally; exact historical active intervals and the start of the user-blocked pause are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Original execution model/reasoning and forecast were not recorded at start.
  Current routing, added `2026-07-19T06:17:38-07:00`, is Sol High with 2–5 active days after all named facts/candidate exist.
- **Time and variance:** Active, wait, blocked, counted, and total elapsed durations remain Unknown/ongoing; variance is
  not calculated before completion.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `4aa36d9`, `0fa5040`, `59d6096`, `849b5a0`, `93e8110`, `d3467cf`,
  [m23-play-declaration-packet.md](m23-play-declaration-packet.md), and [m23-data-safety.md](m23-data-safety.md).
  **Estimated** start proxy.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** Do not backdate the July 19 forecast as original. On resume, record a real resume
  timestamp and retain the current external wait as Unknown rather than inventing a duration.

### M30 — Brand, Content, and Distribution Rights

- **Objective:** Obtain and privately retain written authorization for naming, branding, station assets/metadata,
  streams, screenshots, and Google Play testing/distribution.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest rights-response packet evidence `2026-07-15T22:59:35-07:00`*. Not completed.
  The milestone is waiting externally; exact active intervals and the user-blocked pause start are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Original model/reasoning and forecast were not recorded at start. Current
  routing, added July 19, is Sol High with 0.5–1 active day after written authorization arrives.
- **Time and variance:** Active, wait, blocked, counted, and total elapsed durations remain Unknown/ongoing; variance is
  not calculated before completion.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `c0e37ae`, [m23-owner-response-packet.md](m23-owner-response-packet.md), roadmap `e249071`,
  and forecast `f971a9e`. **Estimated** start proxy.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** External response time must remain separate from reconciliation work. Record the
  actual resume timestamp when authorization arrives.

### M31 — Payments, External Links, and Account Lifecycle Compliance

- **Objective:** Establish the Contact-only Alpha boundary and remove unapproved membership purchase, registration,
  account-management, and direct privacy browser routes.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest implementation evidence `2026-07-18T17:30:30-07:00`*; completed
  `2026-07-18T17:32:28-07:00`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Sol Extra High policy/architecture audit, Terra-bounded implementation, and
  Sol High acceptance are recorded; original hours forecast was not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 0.03 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `9e340b9`, `91794bb`,
  [m31-payments-account-lifecycle-validation.md](m31-payments-account-lifecycle-validation.md), and the indexed Action.
  **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** The two-minute commit window omits the audit/implementation before commit. Model
  routing is not time evidence; future audits must open intervals for review, implementation, and acceptance.

- **Objective:** Harden MediaSession authority, protected station sessions, redirects, canonical IDs, and build integrity,
  with adversarial physical-device evidence.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Actual start Unknown; completed `2026-07-18T18:21:38-07:00`. Category intervals are Unknown.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Exact execution model/reasoning and original forecast not recorded.
- **Time and variance:** Counted and total elapsed time Unknown; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `2bc45f7`, follow-up evidence `1c50ca0`/`cec5d5e`,
  [m32-security-validation.md](m32-security-validation.md), and associated Actions. **Unknown**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** A security milestone with one implementation checkpoint cannot be timed from Git.
  Separately time threat review, code, adversarial tests, and acceptance.

### M33 — Request Transaction Integrity

- **Objective:** Bind each one-shot request to fresh station, account, Queue, readiness, and track identity with bounded
  duplicate suppression.

- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Sol acceptance is recorded; reasoning strength and original forecast are not.
- **Time and variance:** Counted and total elapsed time Unknown; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `572d419`, documentation `b7e10b6`,
  [m33-request-transaction-validation.md](m33-request-transaction-validation.md), and associated Actions. **Unknown**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** The acceptance document proves outcome, not start. Record architecture review,
  implementation, Gradle, device, and acceptance intervals independently.

  `2026-07-19T06:25:48-07:00`. Exact active, automated-wait, and user-blocked intervals are Unknown; human/physical
  checkpoints are documented without full pause/resume timing.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Sol High acceptance is recorded; original individual forecast was not.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 90.27 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `252e3a4` through `6ea021f`, PR #13, [m23-device-compatibility.md](m23-device-compatibility.md),
  and [m23-accessibility-validation.md](m23-accessibility-validation.md). **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** This is the longest observable window because it aggregates many devices and
  human checkpoints, not because 90.27 active hours were measured. Log each matrix campaign and manual gate separately.

### M35 — Release Signing and Console Eligibility

- **Objective:** Prove current-head protected signing, exact upload identity, local clean/update lineage, package
  registration, eligible version code, and a repeatable signed build.
- **Timestamps and intervals:** Earliest focused audit evidence `2026-07-15T22:57:12-07:00`*; completed
  `2026-07-19T05:41:32-07:00`. Active, automated-wait, and user-blocked intervals are Unknown; owner confirmation and
  protected build checkpoints lack complete pause boundaries.
- **Model/reasoning and original forecast:** Sol acceptance is recorded; reasoning strength and original individual
  forecast were not.
- **Time and variance:** Counted time Unknown; minimum observable elapsed 78.74 h; variance Unknown.
- **Evidence/confidence:** `2e839cc`, `89795ef`, `3b775b7`, PR #12, `55413bd`, `97b732d`,
  [m23-release-candidate-audit.md](m23-release-candidate-audit.md), and the indexed Action. **Estimated**.
- **Variance explanation and lesson:** Protected signing and owner/Console checks expanded calendar time, but their
  exact wait is unknown. Future signing milestones must log protected-build start/end and owner-blocked intervals.
