# Windows development handoff

## Mission and repository

Complete **24Seven.FM Player**, an unofficial, fully native Android client for the 24seven.FM radio network. The app uses Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, MVVM, and Jetpack Media3. It must not use a WebView.

- Repository: `https://github.com/codeframe78/24Seven.FM-Player`
- Working branch: `agent/initial-android-scaffold`
- Draft pull request: `https://github.com/codeframe78/24Seven.FM-Player/pull/1`

Clone the current handoff branch on the new PC:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/codeframe78/24Seven.FM-Player.git
Set-Location '24Seven.FM-Player'
git switch agent/initial-android-scaffold
git status
```

Read `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/m2-validation.md`, and `docs/m3-validation.md` before editing. Preserve the existing station-first domain model and dependency boundaries.

## Required Windows environment

- A current Android Studio release
- JDK 17
- Android SDK Platform 35
- Android SDK Platform 36
- Android SDK Build Tools 36.1.0
- Android SDK Platform Tools
- Optional Google APIs x86_64 Android Emulator images for API 35 and API 36

The app compiles against API 36 because the selected AndroidX Activity and Media3 versions require it. It targets API 35 to match the primary Motorola Razr 2023 running Android 15. Minimum SDK is API 26.

Install SDK packages from Android Studio's SDK Manager or with `sdkmanager`:

```powershell
sdkmanager "platforms;android-35" "platforms;android-36" "build-tools;36.1.0" "platform-tools" "system-images;android-35;google_apis;x86_64" "system-images;android-36;google_apis;x86_64"
```

Do not commit `local.properties`. If Android Studio does not discover the SDK automatically, set `ANDROID_HOME` for the current PowerShell session:

```powershell
$env:ANDROID_HOME = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk"
```

The complete Gradle wrapper is committed. Do not install a separate Gradle distribution. Validate the new PC from the repository root:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\validate-windows.ps1
```

The script checks JDK and SDK prerequisites, redirects build output to `%TEMP%`, and runs `test lint assembleDebug`. The equivalent manual command is documented in `README.md`.

## Current implementation

M1 is complete and CI builds the project with JDK 17 and the committed Gradle wrapper. M2 currently includes:

- five-station catalog with station-provided primary and source-fallback URLs;
- immutable playback state behind a domain `PlaybackController` contract;
- Activity-to-service Media3 controller connection;
- one service-owned `ExoPlayer` and `MediaSession`;
- play, pause, stop, and atomic station switching;
- one-step fallback from the primary relay to the source stream;
- Android 13+ notification permission request;
- foreground/background playback with system media pause and resume;
- station metadata in the media notification;
- notification controls that do not expose the internal fallback playlist.

M4 now includes:

- verified ICY titles on all five stations and both relay types;
- immutable station-scoped now-playing state behind a domain repository contract;
- raw title display without heuristic artist/album/composer parsing;
- matching live titles in Compose and Android MediaSession metadata;
- protocol-verified AAC and advertised 128 kbps quality labels.

M5 now includes:

- immutable Player, Chat, Queue, and More destination state;
- working native destinations with capability-aware unavailable states;
- a persistent mini-player on secondary destinations;
- bottom navigation below 600 dp and a navigation rail on wider layouts;
- unit and Compose device coverage for navigation and adaptive branch selection.

M6 groundwork now includes:

- a station-scoped `QueueRepository` domain contract;
- immutable unavailable, loading, ready, and error states;
- native upcoming-queue and recently-played rendering with refresh actions;
- unit and Compose coverage for station scoping and ready-state rendering;
- sanitized source research in `docs/m6-queue-research.md`.

Live M6 data remains blocked. The public players rely on undocumented HTML fragments that failed for four of five stations during verification, while Live Studio reparses complete page HTML. Do not commit or implement those internal requests. Keep all queue/history capabilities disabled until 24seven.FM provides a supported structured feed or written authorization and polling guidance.

The latest successful build validation ran unit tests for debug and release, Android lint, `assembleDebug`, instrumentation APK assembly, and API 35 connected tests. M3 through M5 device validation is complete. See `docs/m1-validation.md`, `docs/m2-validation.md`, `docs/m3-validation.md`, `docs/m4-metadata-research.md`, and `docs/m5-validation.md` for exact evidence.

## Physical Razr setup

The primary device is a Motorola Razr 2023:

- Android 15 / API 35
- device model reported by ADB: `motorola_razr_2023`
- physical display: 1080 x 2640 at 420 dpi

ADB trust keys are specific to each development PC. The new PC must pair again; do not copy old ADB keys. On the phone:

1. Enable Developer options.
2. Open **Settings > System > Developer options > Wireless debugging**.
3. Choose **Pair device with pairing code**.
4. Keep the pairing screen open while running `adb pair <phone-ip>:<pairing-port>` on the new PC.
5. Enter the six-digit code shown by the phone.
6. Return to the main Wireless debugging screen and run `adb connect <phone-ip>:<debug-port>`.
7. Confirm the connection with `adb devices -l`.

The pairing port and debugging port are different and can change. Never commit the phone's LAN/Tailscale address, pairing code, device serial, or screenshots of the Wireless debugging screen. If both PCs and the phone use Tailscale, the phone's current Tailscale address can be used explicitly with `adb pair` and `adb connect`; mDNS discovery is not required.

## Verified device behavior

The Razr has verified:

- primary-stream playback for all five stations;
- two consecutive switching cycles covering all five stations while playback remained active;
- background continuation with a foreground media service;
- notification permission and visible media notification;
- system media pause/resume;
- in-app stop;
- correct session metadata and audio focus;
- no user-facing Next action for the internal fallback item.

Primary-to-source fallback was also verified under a controlled primary-only network failure on a local API 35 emulator. The test left both verified production URLs unchanged and removed its temporary emulator firewall rule afterward.

Before testing, use `adb devices -l` and pass `-s <device>` to ADB commands when an emulator is also running.

## M3 through M5 completion

M3 background-playback hardening is complete. It verified foreground-to-background playback, lock and idle behavior, task removal, notification continuity, system and real Bluetooth media commands, transient and permanent audio-focus policy, real Bluetooth route-disconnect pausing, protected noisy-output broadcast handling, and automated service stop/reconnect behavior. The transient-focus policy automatically resumes after focus returns; permanent focus loss remains paused until the user explicitly resumes playback.

No physical wired or USB-C accessory was available. Do not claim that physical test occurred. The system headset-hook command, Android's protected noisy-output broadcast, and real Bluetooth disconnect cover the relevant application and Media3 paths; physical wired coverage is non-blocking and can be added later.

M4 Now Playing is complete. A continuous physical-device run verified that a changed raw title updated both Compose and the application MediaSession while playback remained healthy. A controlled API 35 emulator run verified that the source fallback item continued publishing a non-empty ICY title after the expected primary failure. Metadata fields and artwork that are not present in the verified ICY source remain intentionally unavailable, and playback does not depend on metadata.

M5 Native Navigation is complete. Player, Chat, Queue, and More are real native destinations, secondary destinations retain a persistent mini-player, and wider layouts select a navigation rail. Chat and Queue intentionally show capability-aware unavailable states until their later protocol milestones; M5 does not guess or implement remote endpoints.

See `docs/m4-metadata-research.md` for per-relay ICY headers, field constraints, implementation evidence, and device results.

An API 35 instrumentation test connects through the real `MediaSessionService`, checks that fallback navigation remains hidden, stops the running service, and reconnects after recreation. Run it against an explicit emulator serial with `ANDROID_SERIAL=<emulator>` and `./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest` when both an emulator and physical device are connected.

The current Windows SDK includes compile platforms 35, 36, and 36.1 plus Google APIs x86_64 emulator images for API 35 and API 36. A temporary API-35 audio-focus helper compiled successfully after Platform 35 was installed; it was uninstalled and deleted after testing.

## Station stream evidence

The exact URLs below came from station-provided PLS files. The trailing semicolon is part of each supplied URL and must not be removed without testing and documentation.

| Station | Primary relay | Source fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| StreamingSoundtracks.com | `http://hi5.streamingsoundtracks.com/;` | `http://hi.streamingsoundtracks.com/;` |
| 1980s.FM | `http://hi5.1980s.fm/;` | `http://hi.1980s.fm/;` |
| Adagio.FM | `http://hi5.adagio.fm/;` | `http://hi.adagio.fm/;` |
| Death.FM | `http://hi5.death.fm/;` | `http://hi.death.fm/;` |
| Entranced.FM | `http://hi5.entranced.fm/;` | `http://hi.entranced.fm/;` |

All ten relays advertise `audio/aacp` and 128 kbps through ICY headers. Cleartext is disabled globally and allowed only for the five station domains. Do not broaden the network security policy or guess HTTPS/API endpoints.

## Architectural invariants

- No WebView.
- Compose receives immutable state and emits actions upward.
- ViewModels depend on repository/controller interfaces, never Media3 or network implementations.
- ExoPlayer remains exclusively service-owned.
- Every station-specific operation accepts or derives a `StationId`.
- Unsupported station features use capability flags.
- Only one station may play at a time.
- Public audio playback must not depend on login, chat, or metadata availability.
- Never commit credentials, cookies, tokens, private endpoints, private network addresses, pairing codes, HAR files, screenshots containing device identifiers, SDK paths, APKs, or build output.

## Git workflow

Continue on `agent/initial-android-scaffold` while PR #1 remains the active draft. Before editing, fetch and confirm the branch has not advanced elsewhere:

```powershell
git fetch origin
git status
git log --oneline --decorate -5
```

Keep commits focused. Do not force-push. Run `git diff --check` and `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\validate-windows.ps1` before publishing implementation changes. The bypass applies only to that PowerShell process and does not change the PC's saved execution policy.
