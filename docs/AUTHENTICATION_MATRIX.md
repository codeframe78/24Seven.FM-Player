# Authentication matrix

Updated July 18, 2026. The five account systems are independent even where their legacy pages and field names are similar. Registration/recovery/management paths below are protocol inventory only and are not linked by the M31 Play artifact. No credential, active cookie, CAPTCHA token, private identifier, or authentication header is recorded here.

| Station | Login discovery | Registration | Password recovery | Account management | Logout | Form/session behavior | Native suitability and limitations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| StreamingSoundtracks.com (`sst`) | HTTPS root supplies the current same-origin login form and alphanumeric CAPTCHA | `/modules.php?name=Your_Account&op=new_user` | Public account flow; exact recovery route not yet separately verified | `/modules.php?name=Your_Account` and `op=edituser` | `op=logout` | `username`, transient password, `gfx_check`, station challenge token; station cookies; same-origin redirects; encrypted restored session | M17 certified: least-privileged native sign-in/restore/logout plus separately bounded VIP request-message and listener-activity evidence |
| 1980s.FM (`1980s`) | Independent 1980s.FM root/form/CAPTCHA; representative native sign-in verified | Same station-relative registration module | Exact recovery route not yet separately verified | Same station-relative account/edit module | Same station-relative logout verified | Separate station ID, expected host, cookie manager entry, encrypted storage key, and auth state; process-restart restoration verified without Keystore errors | M18 complete: MorG sign-in, protected restoration, station isolation, authenticated Favorites/Chat/request availability, and station-only logout verified |
| Adagio.FM (`adagio`) | Independent Adagio.FM root/form/CAPTCHA; representative native sign-in verified | Same station-relative registration module | Exact recovery route not yet separately verified | Same station-relative account/edit module | Same station-relative logout verified | Separate station ID, expected host, cookie manager entry, encrypted storage key, and auth state; process-restart restoration verified without Keystore errors | M19 complete: MorG sign-in, protected restoration, station isolation, authenticated Favorites/Chat/request availability, and station-only logout verified |
| Death.FM (`death`) | Independent Death.FM root/form/CAPTCHA; representative native sign-in verified | Same station-relative registration module | Exact recovery route not yet separately verified | Same station-relative account/edit module | Same station-relative logout verified | Separate station ID, expected host, cookie manager entry, encrypted storage key, and auth state; process-restart restoration verified without Keystore errors | M20 complete: representative sign-in, protected restoration, station isolation, authenticated Favorites/Chat/request availability, and station-only logout verified; M31 removes the historical RIP purchase route |
| Entranced.FM (`entranced`) | Independent Entranced.FM root/form/CAPTCHA; representative native sign-in verified | Same station-relative registration module | Exact recovery route not yet separately verified | Same station-relative account/edit module | Same station-relative logout verified | Separate station ID, expected host, cookie manager entry, encrypted storage key, and auth state; process-restart restoration verified without Keystore errors | M21 complete: MorG sign-in, protected restoration, station isolation, authenticated Favorites/Chat/request availability, and station-only logout verified |

## Isolation implementation

- `StationId` keys every authentication state, challenge, cookie manager, encrypted session record, and encrypted display identity.
- Each network call resolves an exact station origin and rejects cross-origin authentication destinations.
- Protected cookies are filtered to the expected domain before storage and again during restore.
- Signing out clears only the selected station's cookie manager and protected record. Other station sessions remain intact.
- Passwords and CAPTCHA answers are transient method parameters and are not written to Room, DataStore, preferences, logs, resources, build files, or documentation.
- Chat, requests, and Favorites load only the selected station's protected session for that station's expected host.
- SST listener activity uses the same protected station session for exact allowlisted request-history, timer, and profile reads; its memory-only state clears on SST sign-out.
- The native Accounts surface renders all five station states at once. Every refresh, sign-in, and sign-out action carries an explicit `StationId` and does not implicitly target the playback selection.
- A successful protected-session restore remains signed in during a temporary network failure, while a successful station response that proves the saved session invalid produces an explicit `Expired` state and clears only that station.

## M13 verification

- Unit tests cover all-five restoration, explicit-station actions, expiration, one-station logout, and preservation of another signed-in station.
- In-memory and Android Keystore tests cover one-station clear behavior without disturbing another protected session.
- Compose instrumentation covers all five cards, independent status semantics, station-qualified controls, compact scrolling, and explicit action routing.
- All 15 connected instrumentation tests pass on the wired Motorola Razr 2023 running Android 16; physical inspection reached every station card after a fresh install.

## M15 verification

- Representative signed-in SST pages explicitly exposed the last-ten request table, request readiness/wait minutes, and a profile-scoped VIP badge separately from administrative rank.
- Unit tests cover trusted discovery, cross-origin rejection, expired authentication, VIP/RIP/standard/unknown states, cooldown parsing, station-scoped refresh, and sign-out clearing.
- All 19 connected instrumentation tests pass on the wired Motorola Razr 2023 running Android 16; the fresh install physically rendered the explicit signed-out listener-activity state.

## M17 StreamingSoundtracks.com certification

- Existing least-privileged native sign-in, protected restart restoration, logout, Chat post, catalog request, and
  account-gated UI evidence was reconciled with the separate VIP request-message and listener-activity evidence.
- A fresh install remained correctly signed out; Favorites and request activity exposed explicit sign-in boundaries
  rather than leaking cached account data.
- Full unit/lint validation and 21/21 wired Android 16 Razr instrumentation tests passed. A silent physical smoke
  test reconfirmed public playback, metadata/artwork, Queue, Chat, and all five navigation targets.
- A fresh standard-tier production listener-activity refresh remains CAPTCHA-interaction-blocked and is recorded as
  such; the app does not infer VIP status or cooldown behavior from that missing evidence.

## Current gaps

- Registration, recovery, and account-management actions are not yet native destinations or documented Custom Tab actions.
- Membership and request cooldown are enabled only for SST. Representative M18–M21 certification did not expose a reliable native membership/cooldown contract for 1980s.FM, Adagio.FM, Death.FM, or Entranced.FM, so those capabilities remain disabled.
- Representative native sign-in, restored-session isolation, authenticated surfaces, and station-only logout now pass for all five stations. No credentials or challenge answers belong in test fixtures.
- Required future security coverage: representative live listener-activity refresh for every station that is enabled during certification.
