# M3 background playback validation

Validation performed on July 13, 2026.

M3 is in progress. The behavioral checks below passed without requiring a production-code change.

## Motorola Razr 2023

Playback was started on Entranced.FM and verified through each lifecycle transition:

- pressing Home preserved `PLAYING` state, matching session metadata, the application process, the foreground `RadioPlaybackService`, and the media notification;
- locking the device and entering idle preserved playback and the foreground service;
- removing the application task from Recents removed the task while playback, the process, service, session, and notification continued;
- system pause, play, and headset-hook commands updated the MediaSession between `PAUSED` and `PLAYING` as expected;
- transient audio-focus loss paused playback and automatically resumed it after focus returned;
- permanent audio-focus loss paused playback and left it paused after the competing owner abandoned focus, requiring an explicit user resume.

The audio-focus checks used a temporary local helper application compiled against Android API 35. The helper was uninstalled and its source and build output were removed after validation.

## API 35 emulator

A rooted local API 35 emulator was used to send Android's protected `AUDIO_BECOMING_NOISY` broadcast. Active 1980s.FM playback transitioned from `PLAYING` to `PAUSED`, confirming Media3's noisy-output handling. Playback was stopped after the check.

An Android instrumentation test now exercises the real `MediaSessionService` integration without opening a live stream. It connects a `MediaController`, confirms that play/pause remains available while the internal fallback playlist's Next and Previous commands remain hidden, releases the controller, explicitly stops the running service, and reconnects successfully after service recreation. The test passed on the local API 35 emulator.

The full debug and release unit-test suite, Android lint, debug APK assembly, instrumentation APK assembly, and the API 35 connected test passed after this coverage was added.

## Bluetooth hardware

A real Bluetooth A2DP accessory was connected to the Motorola Razr 2023 while StreamingSoundtracks.com was playing. The accessory's play/pause control changed the application MediaSession from `PLAYING` to `PAUSED`, and a second press returned it to `PLAYING`. Powering off or disconnecting the accessory while playback was active removed the A2DP route and automatically changed the application session to `PAUSED`. No playback or fatal application error was recorded. The application was stopped after validation.

## Remaining M3 work

- Exercise controls from real wired-headset hardware.
- Disconnect a real wired audio route during playback and confirm the same pause policy.

Do not mark M3 complete until the remaining hardware coverage is either completed or explicitly descoped.
