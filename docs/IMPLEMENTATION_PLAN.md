# Implementation plan

Updated July 15, 2026 after completing all five station-certification gates and expanding M23 from one oversized distribution task into reviewable Play-testing readiness milestones. Estimates are active Codex elapsed time in this environment, including inspection, implementation, Gradle validation, documentation, Git, and remote confirmation—not traditional human developer time.

## Planning model

- M1–M16 and M18 are complete and retain their existing evidence and published checkpoints.
- M17 is the remaining shared capability, using immutable Compose state, repository contracts, capability flags, and station-isolated protected sessions once its external blocker clears.
- M18–M22 certify the shared implementation against each station. They are hardening and evidence gates, not station-specific application forks.
- Each station's representative native login, protected restoration, isolation, authenticated surface, and logout flow is now a hard completion gate. Public/device evidence may be gathered early but does not advance the active station order.
- M23 is an XL Play-testing readiness program divided into M23.1–M23.7 below; M24 remains the authorized publication gate.
- Private Messages remains numbered as M17 but deferred pending legacy server repair and verified production limits. Inbox and Sent Box discovery worked, while New Message selection remained suspect and a profile-originated MorgHubby test appeared to submit without delivery; the site owner has the reproduced result.
- Early M23 readiness artifacts are preserved, but the signed candidate must be refreshed after the latest notification, library, foldable, and Favorites fixes. The Play developer account is approved; current-head signing, UGC compliance, API 36 targeting, Play review declarations, explicit rights evidence, release-device closure, and publication authorization remain dependencies.

## Task complexity protocol

Before code changes for every roadmap task, state its Task Complexity Level and a brief milestone-specific approach:

- Level 1 — Scaffold & Boilerplate: low reasoning; prioritize speed, Android best practices, clean architecture, concise production-ready code, and minimal explanation.
- Level 2 — Feature Logic & API Integration: medium reasoning; emphasize robust errors, immutable ViewModel state, coroutine/thread safety, implementation detail, test recommendations, and clear state-flow explanation.
- Level 3 — Architectural Refactoring & System Design: high reasoning; compare alternatives, justify the chosen scalable pattern, and assess performance, dependency-injection, maintenance, and side effects.

This classification supplements the required XS–XXL T-shirt size, rationale, estimated duration, confidence check, and high-level task breakdown. Every completed roadmap milestone must be posted as a concise progress update to the configured Discord project thread, with delivery verified before final handoff. Significant visual changes must also include repository and Discord screenshots. A backend-only milestone should explicitly state that it introduced no meaningful visual surface instead of reusing an unrelated image.

## Current milestone

### M23 — Play-Testing Readiness Program

- Task Complexity Level: 2 — Feature Logic & API Integration
- Size: XL as an umbrella, divided into seven S–L sub-milestones
- Estimated elapsed time: 3–6 focused days plus owner and station-side input
- Usage intensity: Medium–High across the complete program
- Confidence: Medium
- Outcome: retain the completed Alpha preparation while closing every release-artifact, UGC, platform-target, Play-review, rights, device, and store-quality boundary needed for a defensible Google Play test release.
- Expected layers: release configuration, domain/repository/UI policy work for UGC, Android 16 behavior validation, secure local signing handoff, privacy/data-safety reconciliation, Play declarations, bundle/APK inspection, device testing, tester documentation, and final repository/Discord evidence.
- Dependencies: approved Google Play developer account, protected upload identity, a real station moderation/report destination or a decision to exclude UGC, written brand/content authorization, reusable reviewer accounts, Play App Signing, and explicit authorization before any publication action.
- Principal risks: shipping publicly accessible UGC without required moderation controls, missing the August 31, 2026 API 36 deadline, or submitting third-party branding/artwork without review-ready permission evidence.
- Completion gate: every required M23.1–M23.6 outcome passes; M23.7 is required before a public store listing but may follow tightly controlled internal QA. No store release is submitted during M23.
- Status: in progress. M23.3 API 36 readiness is complete with 117 unit tests, lint/release bundle validation, 27/27 API 36 connected tests, and a manual cold-launch/two-Back pass. M23.2 UGC research is complete: Play requirements, station Terms/Contact surfaces, missing live-message report identifiers, local-only blocking, and mature-content risk are documented in `m23-ugc-safety-research.md`. Implementation awaits the station-owner moderation confirmation and the product decision to retain or exclude public UGC. M17 Private Messages remains explicitly deferred and is not shipped.

#### M23 sub-milestone plan

| Milestone | Size | Estimate | Usage | Outcome and completion gate | Primary confidence variable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M23.1 Current-head signed release candidate | M | 2–4 hours | Medium | Regenerate the protected signed AAB from exact HEAD; validate signer, version code, 16 KB packaging, merged manifest, dependencies/licenses, Play-delivered install, and reproducible evidence | Access to the protected upload identity and whether version code 2 has already reached Play |
| M23.2 UGC safety and moderation | L, research checkpoint complete; implementation pending | 6–12 hours after station input | High | **In progress:** current Play and station research is recorded in `m23-ugc-safety-research.md`; retain UGC only with non-skippable Terms, clearly labeled report-content/report-user/block-user behavior, mature-content safeguards where applicable, and accountable moderation, otherwise omit Chat/request attribution from the Play candidate | Station authorization for the Contact route, accountable response, and the retain/exclude decision |
| M23.3 Android 16 / API 36 readiness | M | 2–4 hours | Medium | **Complete:** target API 36 with predictive Back, edge-to-edge, adaptive UI, connected MediaSession, lint/release, and 27/27 API 36 device coverage; see `m23-api36-readiness.md` | Closed with one corrected viewport-dependent lazy-list test assumption |
| M23.4 Play review declarations | M | 2–4 hours plus owner input | Medium | Complete reusable reviewer access, media-playback foreground-service description/interruption impact/video, target audience, content rating, privacy reconciliation, and Data Safety | Console wording, CAPTCHA-compatible reviewer access, and station retention answers |
| M23.5 Brand and content-rights evidence | S | 1–2 hours plus external confirmation | Low locally | Privately retain written permission for app/station names, logos, artwork, streams, screenshots, and Play testing/distribution; record only sanitized evidence in Git | Scope and availability of the rights holder's written authorization |
| M23.6 Release device matrix and pre-launch report | M | 3–6 hours | Medium | Exercise API 26, API 36, a 16 KB runtime, genuine tablet/foldable configurations, Razr hinge behavior, Play delivery/update, and remediate pre-launch stability/performance/accessibility findings | AVD/Test Lab availability and Play crawler access through station authentication |
| M23.7 Adaptive launcher/store polish | S | 1–2 hours | Low | Add adaptive and monochrome launcher resources and refresh final screenshots while preserving the selected artwork; required before a public listing, not a blocker for limited internal QA | Quality of derived assets and final release UI stability |

## Latest completed milestone

M23.3 Android 16 / API 36 readiness completed July 15, 2026. The app now targets API 36 without architecture or visible behavior changes. All 117 unit tests, debug lint, release bundle/lint-vital checks, and 27/27 API 36 connected tests pass. A cold API 36 launch confirmed the installed target and the Compose two-Back exit dialog under Android 16 behavior. The initial connected run exposed and corrected a viewport-dependent Favorites test assumption by scrolling the tagged lazy container to each accessibility node. See [m23-api36-readiness.md](m23-api36-readiness.md).

## Shared feature milestones

| Milestone | Size | Estimate | Usage | Rationale and outcome | Primary confidence variable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M17 Private Messages | L (provisional) | 4–8 hours after server repair | High | Add native station-isolated inbox/read/compose/reply/refresh and explicit user-initiated send over existing protected sessions after the reproduced profile-send non-delivery is repaired | Website repair, delivery confirmation, production limits, and consistent authenticated forms |

Each shared milestone includes repository/ViewModel/UI work as applicable, lifecycle-safe state, accessibility semantics, focused tests, affected-module validation, physical Razr inspection, documentation, a focused commit, push, and remote confirmation.

## Station certification milestones

The certification program would be XL if treated as one unit, so it is split into five reviewable S–L milestones. Total expected active elapsed time is 20–35 hours, approximately 3–6 focused days. Confidence is Medium-Low because live accounts, CAPTCHA, station rules, rate limits, metadata quality, and legacy server behavior can differ.

| Milestone | Size | Estimate | Usage | Rationale and focus | Primary confidence variable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M18 StreamingSoundtracks.com certification | S | 2–4 hours | Medium | Most live coverage already exists; certify VIP/non-admin behavior, 30-row Queue, request messages, Favorites, chat, and authenticated workflows | Legacy PM stability and privileged accounts masking ordinary-member restrictions |
| M19 1980s.FM certification | M | 4–7 hours | High | Establish equivalent live evidence for playback/fallback, metadata, account isolation, Queue/history, chat, Favorites, requests, and membership behavior | Availability of a representative station account and undocumented rules |
| M20 Adagio.FM certification | M | 4–7 hours | High | Certify classical metadata presentation plus playback/fallback, account isolation, Queue/history, chat, Favorites, requests, and membership behavior | Metadata shape and availability of a representative station account |
| M21 Death.FM certification | L | 6–10 hours | High | Harden the compact Queue feed, sparse metadata/artwork behavior, RIP membership differences, playback/fallback, chat, Favorites, and requests | Reduced identifiers/metadata and station-specific membership behavior |
| M22 Entranced.FM certification | M | 4–7 hours | High | Establish live evidence for playback/fallback, metadata, account isolation, Queue/history, chat, Favorites, requests, and membership behavior | Availability of a representative station account and undocumented rules |

### Common station task breakdown and completion gate

1. Reconfirm permitted primary/fallback playback and Media3 behavior without changing working URLs casually.
2. Verify metadata, artwork, Queue/history limits, stale/error handling, and station-scoped parsing.
3. Verify independent authentication, restoration, expiration, logout, and account capability presentation.
4. Verify chat read/post limits, Favorites discovery, requests, eligibility, cooldown, attribution/messages, and Private Messages when available.
5. Preserve unsupported differences as explicit capability-unavailable states; never guess endpoints or rules.
6. Add or update parser, repository, ViewModel, Compose, accessibility, and isolation tests for station-specific evidence.
7. Run focused and broad validators, perform a physical Razr smoke test, update matrices/handoff, commit, push, and confirm the remote branch.

M18–M22 are complete while M17 remains deferred; every in-scope station capability now has passing evidence or an explicit certified unavailable/unverified boundary.

## Distribution milestones

| Milestone | Size | Estimate | Usage | Rationale and outcome | Primary confidence variable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M23 Alpha Test Distribution Readiness | M | 1–2 focused days | Medium | Refresh privacy, tester guidance, signing guardrails, versioning, release artifacts, bundle checks, and Play readiness after M15–M22 | Custody/configuration of the upload signing identity and Console declarations |
| M24 Alpha publication completion | M | 1–3 hours after Console setup | Medium | Produce and verify the authorized signed Play bundle and internal/closed test release | Signing authorization, tester-track configuration, and release review outcome |

No item is classified XL. Any future phase that exceeds L will be divided before implementation.
