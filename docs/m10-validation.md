# M10 validation

Validated July 14, 2026 against a physical Android 15 (API 35) Motorola Razr 2023.

- The live public queue displayed requester identity and its separate message without merging either into track metadata.
- The authenticated StreamingSoundtracks.com post-request form was inspected read-only before controlled live validation.
- The native confirmation dialog renders the optional message field only for the verified station, enforces the published 80-character limit, and emits the value only on explicit confirmation.
- The first live message attempt did not appear in Queue. The adapter was corrected to mirror `msg`, `send`, and `remLen`, preserve the referer, and upgrade only the station's same-host legacy HTTP redirect to its verified HTTPS equivalent.
- A second administrator-approved Razr attempt queued the selected song and displayed `Requested by MorgHubby`, but no message. The app reported an indeterminate song-response result. Inspection confirmed that the station accepted the one-shot song mutation while the client was still waiting for its response, so the previous sequence exited before reaching the separate message POST.
- A subsequent live app attempt also queued its song without a message. The form-loading recovery hypothesis was disproved by a fresh, controlled browser workflow rather than another speculative app submission.
- The fresh browser request selected `Just Testing` by Maurice Jarre from *Soleil Rouge*. The request link used station song ID `263260`, while the resulting server-generated message form used a distinct message-record ID, `2055716`. Submitting `M10 fresh browser workflow` through that fresh form returned `Your message has been saved`, and the public Queue displayed the exact message beside `Requested by MorgHubby`.
- This proves the previous adapter's root defect: it reused the song ID as the message form's `id`. The corrected adapter extracts the action from the accepted response, requires the exact same-origin Album `submitmessage` route, matching album ID, numeric server-generated message ID, and the `msg`, `send`, and `remLen` controls, then posts once with the actual response URL as referer.
- If the song response is unreadable, the app no longer guesses a message ID or attempts a message POST. The song request is never retried. The read timeout is 60 seconds to accommodate the slow station response while preserving this safety rule.
- Unit tests, Android lint, and release assembly pass.
- All 10 instrumentation tests pass on the Razr. AGP 8.13's Windows UTP profile writer cannot create a filename containing a wireless ADB serial's colon, so the already-built debug and test APKs were installed and the same AndroidJUnitRunner suite was invoked directly on the device.

M10 remains in progress until the server-generated-ID build is confirmed on one future eligible native-app request.
Previously confirmed requests were not retried and must not be resubmitted for validation.
