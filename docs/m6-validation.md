# M6 queue and history validation

Validated on July 13, 2026.

## Automated coverage

- the parser maps explicit track title, artist, cover, and row order without inventing album or duration fields;
- malformed rows are skipped;
- artwork outside the selected station domain is rejected;
- polling starts immediately only while Queue is observed;
- automatic and manual refresh share a hard 60-second minimum interval;
- station selection cancels the old station flow and observes the new station;
- leaving Queue cancels the active observation;
- initial failures expose a generic error without server response details;
- all five catalog entries expose only the administrator-authorized queue and history capabilities;
- Compose renders unavailable, loading, error, empty, queue, history, artist, and artwork-ready states natively.

## Physical-device evidence

The API 35 Motorola Razr 2023 received a fresh debug install over wireless ADB. Playback was not started.

A one-time on-device integration test made one authorized request per station. StreamingSoundtracks.com, 1980s.FM, Adagio.FM, Death.FM, and Entranced.FM each returned a non-empty queue, non-empty history, nonblank explicit titles, and station-hosted cover URLs. The temporary live-network test was removed afterward so the permanent test suite does not depend on external availability.

On 2026-07-13, the queue adapter was extended to display at most 30 upcoming and 30 played tracks from the public `Queue_Played` tables. Parser tests verify explicit field extraction, removal of requester text from titles, same-station artwork enforcement, and the 30-row ceiling. Death.FM retains its verified compact feed because its extended interface was unreliable; this keeps every refresh to one request and preserves the 60-second limiter.

Physical-device inspection then exposed a legacy nested-table edge case: the Queue and Played tables share an outer layout table. The parser now considers only rows owned by each inner section table, preventing recently played tracks from being appended to the numbered upcoming queue. The nested live structure is covered by regression tests.

The native StreamingSoundtracks.com Queue screen was visually inspected. It displayed ordered upcoming tracks, track title above artist, station cover artwork, refresh control, persistent mini-player, and phone bottom navigation. The inspection caught and corrected an initial field-semantic mismatch before publication. Temporary screenshots and UI hierarchy files were deleted and were not committed.

## Build gate

The final local validation passed debug and release unit tests, Android lint, debug APK assembly, and instrumentation APK assembly. The permanent four-test Compose and MediaSession suite also passed on the API 35 physical device. GitHub Android CI is verified after publication; see the PR checks for its final result.
