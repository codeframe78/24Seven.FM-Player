# Architecture

24Seven.FM Player is a native Kotlin/Compose application. It uses MVVM with unidirectional data flow and keeps Android UI, playback, and remote protocols independent.

## Dependency direction

```text
Compose UI -> ViewModel -> domain repository interface
                               ^
                               |
                         data implementation

Compose UI -> ViewModel -> playback interface -> Media3 implementation
```

The UI must not import Retrofit, OkHttp, cookies, WebSockets, or ExoPlayer. A screen receives immutable UI state and emits actions to its ViewModel.

## Station scope

`StationId` is required for station-specific metadata, chat, queues, history, and requests. Do not assume that every station supports every feature. `StationCapabilities` controls which destinations and actions are shown.

The bundled catalog contains identities and public website addresses only. Stream URLs and protocol endpoints must come from a reviewed source rather than guesses embedded in UI code.

The initial stream addresses were extracted from station-provided PLS playlists. Each catalog entry keeps the primary `hi5` relay first and the `hi` source stream as a fallback. Because those playlists use HTTP, Android cleartext access is permitted only for the five explicit station domains; cleartext remains disabled globally.

All ten committed relay URLs advertise `audio/aacp` and 128 kbps through ICY headers. The catalog therefore records `StreamFormat.Aac` and 128 kbps based on protocol evidence, not hostname inference. Revalidate this evidence before changing the labels.

Live ICY titles flow from the service-owned player through a station-scoped `NowPlayingRepository` contract. Compose receives only immutable domain state. ICY supplies one composite title, so the application displays it unchanged and does not guess artist, album, composer, duration, or artwork fields.


## Playback ownership

`RadioPlaybackService` owns the single `ExoPlayer` and `MediaSession`. The application connects through a Media3 `MediaController` adapter implementing the domain-facing `PlaybackController` interface. Switching stations stops the current item and atomically replaces the playlist with the selected station's ordered primary and fallback streams; two stations can never play simultaneously. The service advances to the fallback once when the primary stream fails.

## Native navigation

The selected Player, Chat, Queue, or More destination is immutable `MainUiState` owned by `MainViewModel`. Destination composables emit navigation and playback actions upward. Secondary destinations reuse the same domain playback and now-playing state through a persistent mini-player; they never connect to Media3 directly.

The phone shell uses bottom navigation below 600 dp. Wider layouts use a navigation rail and content pane. Chat remains a navigable unavailable destination. Queue content is controlled by verified station capability flags and repository state.

## Queue and history

`QueueRepository` is station-scoped and exposes immutable unavailable, loading, ready, and error state. `MainViewModel` observes it only while Queue is selected, switches the flow when `StationId` changes, and cancels observation when leaving Queue. Compose only renders the resulting state or emits a refresh action upward.

`PollingQueueRepository` performs one request immediately and then no more than once every 60 seconds. Manual refresh uses the same limiter. The remote adapter supplies the player request headers, bounded I/O, station mapping, JSON extraction, and defensive HTML parsing. The parser preserves explicit title and artist fields, does not infer missing album or duration values, and only accepts artwork hosted by the selected station domain. See `docs/m6-queue-research.md`.

## Authentication

Authentication will live behind `AuthRepository`. Composables never read or store cookies. If the network uses legacy form login, its CSRF, redirect, and session-cookie behavior will be handled by the data layer. No credentials or captured session values belong in the repository.

The contract and UI state are station-scoped because shared accounts and sessions have not been verified. The
default implementation remains unavailable, and authentication capability flags remain false until explicit
authorization and protocol evidence exist. See `docs/m7-auth-research.md`.

## Chat

Chat will depend on a replaceable transport contract. Network inspection must determine whether each station uses WebSocket, server-sent events, long polling, or ordinary polling before an implementation is selected.

## Initial modules

The project begins as one Android application module organized by package. Modules should be split only when boundaries are stable enough to justify the additional Gradle complexity.
