# Architecture

24Seven.FM Player is a native Kotlin/Compose application. It uses MVVM with unidirectional data flow and keeps Android UI, playback, and remote protocols independent.

## Dependency direction

```text
Compose UI -> ViewModel -> domain repository interface
                               ^
                               |
                         data implementation

Compose UI -> ViewModel -> playback interface -> Media3 implementation
```

The UI must not import Retrofit, OkHttp, cookies, WebSockets, or ExoPlayer. A screen receives immutable UI state and emits actions to its ViewModel.

## Station scope

`StationId` is required for station-specific metadata, chat, queues, history, and requests. Do not assume that every station supports every feature. `StationCapabilities` controls which destinations and actions are shown.

The bundled catalog contains identities and public website addresses only. Stream URLs and protocol endpoints must come from a reviewed source rather than guesses embedded in UI code.

The initial stream addresses were extracted from station-provided PLS playlists. Each catalog entry keeps the primary `hi5` relay first and the `hi` source stream as a fallback. Because those playlists use HTTP, Android cleartext access is permitted only for the five explicit station domains; cleartext remains disabled globally.

All ten committed relay URLs advertise `audio/aacp` and 128 kbps through ICY headers. The catalog therefore records `StreamFormat.Aac` and 128 kbps based on protocol evidence, not hostname inference. Revalidate this evidence before changing the labels.

Live ICY titles flow from the service-owned player through a station-scoped `NowPlayingRepository` contract. Compose receives only immutable domain state. ICY supplies one composite title, so the application displays it unchanged and does not guess artist, album, composer, or duration fields. On each distinct ICY title, the service requests the station's public current-track record once and optionally enriches state and MediaSession metadata with an explicit same-station cover URL. This is event-driven rather than separately polled, and artwork failure never affects playback or title updates.


## Playback ownership

`RadioPlaybackService` owns the single `ExoPlayer` and `MediaSession`. The application connects through a Media3 `MediaController` adapter implementing the domain-facing `PlaybackController` interface. Switching stations stops the current item and atomically replaces the playlist with the selected station's ordered primary and fallback streams; two stations can never play simultaneously. The service advances to the fallback once when the primary stream fails.

## Native navigation

The selected Player, Chat, Queue, or More destination is immutable `MainUiState` owned by `MainViewModel`. Destination composables emit navigation and playback actions upward. Secondary destinations reuse the same domain playback and now-playing state through a persistent mini-player; they never connect to Media3 directly.

The phone shell uses bottom navigation below 600 dp. Wider layouts use a navigation rail and content pane. Chat, Favorites, Queue, and authenticated listener activity remain controlled by verified station capability flags and repository state.

## Secondary station content

`StationPage` and `StationPageKind` are immutable domain models attached to each catalogued station. A dedicated
`supportsSecondaryContent` capability controls whether the native More directory is shown. Compose emits the selected
page upward and never launches an external app directly.

The M31 Play catalog contains exactly one Contact entry per station. `MainActivity` validates it through
`StationPageTrustPolicy` and opens the fixed monitored recipient through `ACTION_SENDTO`; the email app owns the draft
and final send. VIP/RIP membership pages were verified to advertise paid digital benefits and registration, so they
are absent from the catalog and the trust policy rejects `Membership` even if accidentally supplied. The native
Privacy notice also routes questions back to Contact rather than launching a separate browser account surface.

The exact-entry same-origin HTTPS Custom Tab boundary remains dormant for any future authorized public page. It validates
scheme, origin, credentials, fragments, and port before launch and never copies the protected app session. Forum access
is retired and must not be catalogued; M57 must re-audit reachable navigation—including legacy subscription and
registration links—before cataloguing any future account route. See `docs/m31-payments-account-lifecycle-validation.md`.

## Queue and history

`QueueRepository` is station-scoped and exposes immutable unavailable, loading, ready, and error state. `MainViewModel` observes it only while Queue is selected, switches the flow when `StationId` changes, and cancels observation when leaving Queue. Compose only renders the resulting state or emits a refresh action upward.

`PollingQueueRepository` performs one request immediately and then no more than once every 60 seconds. Manual refresh uses the same limiter. The remote adapter supplies bounded I/O, station mapping, and defensive parsing for each station's public queue source. Extended sources display at most 30 upcoming and 30 recently played tracks; compact sources display the rows they provide. The parser preserves explicit track fields, does not guess unavailable fields, and only accepts artwork hosted by the selected station domain. See `docs/m6-queue-research.md`.

Extended queue rows may also expose an explicit `req-text` attribution element. The parser keeps its profile-link
requester and optional italic message separate from track metadata, bounds both fields, and passes plain immutable
strings to Compose. It never infers attribution from unrelated links. See `docs/m10-request-attribution-research.md`.

`SongRequestRepository` owns station-scoped transient search, album, suggestion, eligibility, confirmation, and
submission state. Catalog reads are user initiated and never polled; explicit random and least-played actions use
the station's own suggestion parameters. The remote adapter accepts only same-origin HTTPS album and request actions,
and submission requires the M07 protected station session. Compose receives immutable state and emits search,
suggestion, album, prepare, cancel, and confirm actions upward. A state-changing request is made only after
two explicit actions and is never retried. StreamingSoundtracks.com's separately verified request-message
capability adds a transient 80-character field to confirmation; a non-blank value is posted only after the song
request is accepted, and a message failure cannot repeat the song mutation. See `docs/m9-request-research.md` and
`docs/m10-request-attribution-research.md`.

## Authentication

Authentication lives behind the station-scoped `AuthRepository`; Compose receives immutable state and emits
actions without reading cookies. The data layer owns the verified legacy form challenge, same-origin redirects,
bounded responses, session cookies, and signed-in response classification. Passwords and security-code answers
remain transient.

Session cookies and display identity are encrypted with an Android Keystore AES-GCM key. Restored sessions are
revalidated when the station is reachable; an anonymous response clears them, while a network failure preserves
the protected cached identity so public playback remains available offline. Sign-out clears both the in-memory
cookie manager and protected storage even if the remote logout request fails. See `docs/m7-auth-research.md` and
`docs/m7-validation.md`.

`ListenerActivityRepository` owns memory-only authenticated request history, cooldown/readiness, and explicit
membership evidence. `MainViewModel` observes it only for a verified station while More is selected and refreshes
only on destination entry or an explicit listener action; there is no polling or mutation. The SST adapter reads an
exact last-ten history page and only follows same-origin allowlisted timer/profile sources discovered in that page.
Administrative rank, newsletter subscription wording, and generic navigation never imply VIP/RIP membership.
Unsupported or missing evidence remains explicit `Unknown`, and sign-out clears only that station's activity state.
See `docs/m15-request-activity-research.md`.

## Chat

Chat depends on a station-scoped `ChatRepository`. `MainViewModel` observes it only while Chat is selected and
cancels collection on destination or station changes. The verified public interface uses a same-origin HTML view
with a 30-second browser reload, so the repository applies the same minimum interval to scheduled and manual
reads. Parsed messages are bounded and memory-only. Compose renders plain immutable author, message, and displayed
timestamp values.

Posting is available only with a protected station session. The data layer obtains the current same-origin form,
keeps its station-issued account material transient, enforces the 255-character ISO-8859-1 boundary, submits the
user's message, and performs one confirmation read. Cookies and posting material never reach the ViewModel or UI.
See `docs/m8-chat-research.md`.

The opt-in M27 notification slice remains behind `CommunityNotificationRepository`. `MainViewModel` supplies only
the signed-in station identity, immutable Chat snapshot, and station-local block identities while Chat is selected. The
first snapshot establishes a no-alert baseline; later exact-name matches exclude the signed-in author and locally blocked
authors while still fingerprinting blocked messages so unblocking cannot surface stale alerts. Duplicate suppression keeps at most 200 SHA-256 message fingerprints per enabled station in memory and never
persists Chat text. The Android implementation stores only enabled station IDs, posts a dedicated private-channel
notification containing station and sender but no message body, and deep-links through the existing community gates.
It does not expand Chat polling or claim closed-app push delivery. See `docs/m27-community-notification-validation.md`.

## Community safety and moderation

Community access and moderation live behind `CommunitySafetyRepository`. `MainViewModel` depends only on that domain
contract and prevents Chat observation/posting and attributed request contribution until immutable safety state confirms
an adult age-screen result, acceptance of the current Terms version, and a separate community-content reveal. Compose
renders the gate, report form, and block management from state and emits actions upward.

The SharedPreferences implementation stores only the adult/not-adult result, accepted Terms version, visibility
preference, and station-scoped normalized blocked identities. The entered date of birth and all report form/submission
data remain transient. Block filtering is applied in the ViewModel to public Chat and Queue/History requester
attribution; it is explicitly device-local and does not claim to mute or ban a station account.

The repository bounds every report field and prepares an immutable transient email draft addressed only to the
owner-authorized monitored moderation contact. `MainActivity` performs the Android `ACTION_SENDTO` handoff so Compose
still emits actions upward and neither the ViewModel nor repository depends on Android intents. The user reviews and
sends the draft in their chosen email app; the Player does not access email credentials, send silently, or claim that
opening the composer proves sending or delivery. Contact Us uses the same fixed-recipient handoff, while other approved
station links retain the same-origin HTTPS Custom Tab trust policy.
See `docs/m23-ugc-safety-research.md` and `docs/m23-ugc-safety-validation.md`.

## Initial modules

The project begins as one Android application module organized by package. Modules should be split only when boundaries are stable enough to justify the additional Gradle complexity.
