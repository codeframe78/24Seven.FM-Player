# Architecture

24Seven.FM Player is a native Kotlin/Compose application. It uses MVVM with unidirectional data flow and keeps Android UI, playback, and remote protocols independent.

## Dependency direction

```text
Compose UI -> ViewModel -> domain repository interface
                               ^
                               |
                         data implementation

Compose UI -> ViewModel -> playback interface -> Media3 implementation
```

The UI must not import Retrofit, OkHttp, cookies, WebSockets, or ExoPlayer. A screen receives immutable UI state and emits actions to its ViewModel.

## Station scope

`StationId` is required for station-specific metadata, chat, queues, history, and requests. Do not assume that every station supports every feature. `StationCapabilities` controls which destinations and actions are shown.

The bundled catalog contains identities and public website addresses only. Stream URLs and protocol endpoints must come from a reviewed source rather than guesses embedded in UI code.

The initial stream addresses were extracted from station-provided PLS playlists. Each catalog entry keeps the primary `hi5` relay first and the `hi` source stream as a fallback. Because those playlists use HTTP, Android cleartext access is permitted only for the five explicit station domains; cleartext remains disabled globally.

All ten committed relay URLs advertise `audio/aacp` and 128 kbps through ICY headers. The catalog therefore records `StreamFormat.Aac` and 128 kbps based on protocol evidence, not hostname inference. Revalidate this evidence before changing the labels.

Live ICY titles flow from the service-owned player through a station-scoped `NowPlayingRepository` contract. Compose receives only immutable domain state. ICY supplies one composite title, so the application displays it unchanged and does not guess artist, album, composer, or duration fields. On each distinct ICY title, the service requests the station's public current-track record once and optionally enriches state and MediaSession metadata with an explicit same-station cover URL. This is event-driven rather than separately polled, and artwork failure never affects playback or title updates.


## Playback ownership

`RadioPlaybackService` owns the single `ExoPlayer` and `MediaSession`. The application connects through a Media3 `MediaController` adapter implementing the domain-facing `PlaybackController` interface. Switching stations stops the current item and atomically replaces the playlist with the selected station's ordered primary and fallback streams; two stations can never play simultaneously. The service advances to the fallback once when the primary stream fails.

## Native navigation

The selected Player, Chat, Queue, or More destination is immutable `MainUiState` owned by `MainViewModel`. Destination composables emit navigation and playback actions upward. Secondary destinations reuse the same domain playback and now-playing state through a persistent mini-player; they never connect to Media3 directly.

The phone shell uses bottom navigation below 600 dp. Wider layouts use a navigation rail and content pane. Chat remains a navigable unavailable destination. Queue content is controlled by verified station capability flags and repository state.

## Queue and history

`QueueRepository` is station-scoped and exposes immutable unavailable, loading, ready, and error state. `MainViewModel` observes it only while Queue is selected, switches the flow when `StationId` changes, and cancels observation when leaving Queue. Compose only renders the resulting state or emits a refresh action upward.

`PollingQueueRepository` performs one request immediately and then no more than once every 60 seconds. Manual refresh uses the same limiter. The remote adapter supplies bounded I/O, station mapping, and defensive parsing for each station's public queue source. Extended sources display at most 30 upcoming and 30 recently played tracks; compact sources display the rows they provide. The parser preserves explicit track fields, does not guess unavailable fields, and only accepts artwork hosted by the selected station domain. See `docs/m6-queue-research.md`.

`SongRequestRepository` owns station-scoped transient search, album, eligibility, confirmation, and submission
state. Catalog reads are user initiated and never polled. The remote adapter accepts only same-origin HTTPS album
and request actions, and submission requires the M7 protected station session. Compose receives immutable state
and emits search, album, prepare, cancel, and confirm actions upward. A state-changing request is made only after
two explicit actions and is never retried. See `docs/m9-request-research.md`.

## Authentication

Authentication lives behind the station-scoped `AuthRepository`; Compose receives immutable state and emits
actions without reading cookies. The data layer owns the verified legacy form challenge, same-origin redirects,
bounded responses, session cookies, and signed-in response classification. Passwords and security-code answers
remain transient.

Session cookies and display identity are encrypted with an Android Keystore AES-GCM key. Restored sessions are
revalidated when the station is reachable; an anonymous response clears them, while a network failure preserves
the protected cached identity so public playback remains available offline. Sign-out clears both the in-memory
cookie manager and protected storage even if the remote logout request fails. See `docs/m7-auth-research.md` and
`docs/m7-validation.md`.

## Chat

Chat depends on a station-scoped `ChatRepository`. `MainViewModel` observes it only while Chat is selected and
cancels collection on destination or station changes. The verified public interface uses a same-origin HTML view
with a 30-second browser reload, so the repository applies the same minimum interval to scheduled and manual
reads. Parsed messages are bounded and memory-only. Compose renders plain immutable author, message, and displayed
timestamp values.

Posting is available only with a protected station session. The data layer obtains the current same-origin form,
keeps its station-issued account material transient, enforces the 255-character ISO-8859-1 boundary, submits the
user's message, and performs one confirmation read. Cookies and posting material never reach the ViewModel or UI.
See `docs/m8-chat-research.md`.

## Initial modules

The project begins as one Android application module organized by package. Modules should be split only when boundaries are stable enough to justify the additional Gradle complexity.
