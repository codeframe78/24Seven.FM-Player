# Google Play store listing draft

Prepared for the `24Seven.FM Player` application created in Play Console on July 15, 2026. Keep the listing accurate to the artifact being submitted and do not imply official endorsement.

## Default listing — English (United States)

**App name (17/30)**

24Seven.FM Player

**Short description (79/80)**

Native live radio for five 24Seven.FM stations, with queues, chat and requests.

**Full description**

Listen to all five 24Seven.FM radio stations in one fully native Android player:

- StreamingSoundtracks.com
- 1980s.FM
- Adagio.FM
- Death.FM
- Entranced.FM

Move between stations without losing the player, continue listening in the background, and control playback from Android media controls, notifications, headsets, and Bluetooth devices. The player shows available live metadata and artwork, clearly communicates buffering or reconnection states, and preserves the selected station across restarts.

Explore each station's upcoming queue and recently played tracks. Where the station supports them, signed-in members can use native chat, browse favorites, search the station library by title, album, artist, or genre, sort requestable tracks by station order or play state, and explicitly confirm song requests and optional request messages. Station accounts and capabilities remain station-specific.

Community content is hidden by default behind an adult age screen, Terms acceptance, and a separate reveal action. The app provides distinct report-content, report-user, and block-user controls, including station-scoped local block management.

Device-local startup preferences can resume the last station or use a chosen station. Responsive layouts support phones, tablets, foldables, rotation, and resizable windows.

Public listening does not require an account. The app contains no ads, analytics, tracking SDKs, or developer-operated data server.

24Seven.FM Player is an unofficial, non-commercial community client. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by 24Seven.FM or its individual stations. Feature availability depends on each station's public interfaces and account eligibility rules.

The existing store graphics and screenshots were revalidated during M23. No recapture was needed because launcher
polish does not alter the in-app Player, Queue, or adaptive-layout surfaces represented by those assets.

Screenshots must show the actual app, avoid credentials or protected sessions, and avoid using public chat/requester content that could create unnecessary personal-data exposure in marketing assets.
