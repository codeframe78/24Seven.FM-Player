# Privacy notice for 24Seven.FM Player Alpha

Last updated: July 14, 2026.

24Seven.FM Player is an unofficial, non-commercial native Android client for the five public 24Seven.FM radio stations. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by 24Seven.FM or its stations.

## Data the app handles

- **Radio and public station data:** The app connects directly to the selected station to play audio and retrieve public now-playing, queue, history, artwork, catalog, chat, and the signed-in member's public favorite-track list.
- **Account credentials:** A username, password, and station security code are sent only to the selected station when the user explicitly signs in. Passwords and security-code answers are held only long enough to complete that sign-in attempt and are not written to app storage.
- **Station sessions:** Successful station cookies and the returned display identity are encrypted locally using an Android Keystore key. Sessions are scoped to the exact station and can be removed with Sign out or by clearing the app's data.
- **User submissions:** Chat posts, song requests, and optional request messages are sent only after an explicit user action. The app does not automate or bulk-submit requests.
- **Chat history:** Chat messages are kept in memory for the current app session and are not persisted by the app.
- **Favorite tracks:** Favorite lists are loaded only after station sign-in, kept in memory, and cleared from the interface when the user signs out. They are not written to app storage.
- **Request activity and membership:** Where verified for a station, the app can load the signed-in member's recent request summaries, station-reported request readiness, and explicit membership indicator. These values are kept in memory, cleared from the interface on sign-out, and are not written to app storage.
- **External station pages:** Selected public station pages open only after an explicit tap in an Android browser Custom Tab. The app passes an allowlisted same-station HTTPS address but does not copy its protected station session into the browser. Browser cookies, history, and retention are controlled by the selected browser and station independently of this app.

The application does not include advertising, analytics, crash-reporting, tracking SDKs, or a developer-operated data server. Station operators and network providers may independently retain normal server or network logs; those systems are outside this application's control.

## Android permissions

- **Internet:** Required for live streams and station features.
- **Network state:** Used by the media/network libraries to detect connectivity changes and present connection or retry states.
- **Foreground media playback:** Required to continue audio while the app is in the background and to expose system media controls.
- **Notifications:** On Android 13 and newer, used for the media-playback notification. Denying it may reduce visible background playback controls.

The app does not request contacts, location, microphone, camera, photos, phone, SMS, or broad file-storage access.

## Retention and deletion

Protected station sessions remain on the device until Sign out, app-data clearing, or uninstall. Chat, favorite-track lists, request activity, membership indicators, and pending song-request text are transient. Android's app settings can clear all locally retained application data.

## Alpha limitations

This is pre-release software. Testers should use a non-administrator station account where practical and should not include credentials, private messages, session values, or security-code images in bug reports.

The application is maintained by the community contributors to the `codeframe78/24Seven.FM-Player` project. Privacy questions and reports can be submitted through [the project's GitHub issue channel](https://github.com/codeframe78/24Seven.FM-Player/issues) without sensitive account information.
